Vampire-mania has gripped River Heights, with teenage girls going wild over the new "DieLite" novels and movies. But what happens when a supposedly "real" handsome young vampire arrives on the scene? Will Nancy expose him as a fraud &#x2015; or fall under his dark spell? As if that weren't enough, something dark and sinister unfolds while everyone's distracted by the vampire madness!</p><p><p><b>Stefan Petrucha</b> has written X-Files comics and for Disney comics. He is the author of such YA series as "Timetripper" (Razorbill), "Wicked Dead" with Thomas Pendleton (Harper Collins) and "The Rule of Won," which was published in September 2008 to rave reviews. Stefan has written every Nancy Drew Graphic Novel from Papercutz to date with more to come.</p><p><b>Sarah Kinney</b> has written over 150 original Disney comics for Egmont Publishing. She recently finished scripting the animated feature "Blaze of Glory" for Santoon Productions. </p><p><b>Sho Murase</b> is active in animation. Her first graphic novel "SEI" was published by Image Comics in 2003, and she quickly moved on to illustrate more than a dozen graphic novels. Her art has been displayed at galleries around the world including the German Film Museum in Frankfurt, and the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark.</p>Heres a graphic-novel spoof that shouldnt work but does: Nancy Drew, the iconic girl detective born in the syndicate age and still alive and adolescent 80 years on, seemingly dumps boyfriend Ned for the new kid in River Heights, Gregor the vampire. Friends and gofers to the girl detective, George and Bess engage Ned to help them sleuth on the sleuth. Text and dramatically colored images are nicely bound into a codependent stream, while the characters are drawn to appear as flat and stereotypical as Stratemeyer could ever imagine. There are plenty of cultural references at play here, but even the vampire-shy will find the silliness diverting. The cliff-hanger ending will leave readers dying for the next volume of the Nancy Drew: The New Case Files graphic-novel series, or maybe have them hopping into their roadsters to go save Nancyor maybe Gregor?themselves.

The painted and carved wooden screens, chests and boxes for storage and cooking, dishes, rattles, crest hats, and other ceremonial paraphernalia reveal a rare artistic virtuosity and document the unique involvement of these craftsmen with their environment.<p>After many years of examining countless artifacts, from Bella Coola to Yakutat Bay, and after himself creating objects in the same style, artist-teacher Bill Holm makes available the results of his investigation in this handsomely illustrated volume. With his deep knowledge and understanding of Indian art, the author has recognized how these pieces, although varied in origin, material, size, and purpose, are related to a surprising degree in the organization and form of their two-dimensional surface decoration.</p><p>The author presents an incisive analysis of the use of color, line, and texture; the organization of space; and such typical forms as ovoids, eyelids, U forms, and hands and feet. The evidence upon which he bases his conclusions constitutes a repository of valuable information for all succeeding researchers in the field.</p></p><p><strong>Bill Holm</strong>, artist and teacher, is a leading authority on the art and customs of Northwest Coast Indians. He has held the positions of curator emeritus of Northwest Coast Indian Art at the Thomas Burke Memorial Washington State Museum, and professor emeritus of art history at the University of Washington. He lives in Seattle, Washington."The drawings, together with suitable photographs and a beautiful format, combine into a masterpiece of printer's art."&#x2015;<i>Art Journal</i><p>"[A]n indispensable text for anyone wishing to penetrate beyond the narrative and ceremonial aspects of Northwest Coast Indian art."&#x2015;<i>Vancouver Sun</i></p><p>"Holm inspired a renaissance .. Terminology he invented .. are today the standard way of referring to the art."&#x2015;<i>Seattle Times</i></p></p><h2>You Can&#39;t Go Home Again</h2><p>The story of an artist who flees scandal, bitterness, and despair as he journeys from his family home in a small southern town to New York and prewar Europe. This is Thomas Wolfe&#39;s famous last novel--the odyssey of an American in search of himself and in search of his native land.</p><p></p><h2>The Cross And the Switchblade</h2><p>Gangfighters, drug addicts, teenage runaways, and prostitutes--the toughest and most hopeless kids that New York&#39;s ghettos had to offer. That is, until a country preacher from the Pennsylvania hills arrived on their turf and began preaching a streetcorner message of renewal, miracles, and God&#39;s love. David Wilkerson, a man on a mission, stepped onto some of the world&#39;s most dangerous streets armed only with the simple message of God&#39;s love and the promise of the Holy Spirit&#39;s power. And that&#39;s when the miracles began to happen. Led by incredible faith, Wilkerson left his country pulpit in 1958 for the streets of New York City, where a murder trial of seven teenaged boys churned society&#39;s antipathy toward them. Even Wilkerson was bewildered by his sense of compassion, but in spite of doubt, he followed the Spirit&#39;s prompting to help the boys. This is the amazing story of his journey, and the ability of God to accomplish the impossible. One of the most inspiring and challenging true stories of all time, it has sold millions of copies throughout the world and has been made into a feature film.</p><p><p><strong>David Wilkerson</strong> (1931-2011) was an Assembly of God pastor who established Teen Challenge, an organization centered around the needs of converts of his successful street evangelism ministry in New York City. As part of Teen Challenge, he also established the Bible Institute, which evolved into the international organization known as World Challenge. David also cofounded Times Square church in New York City. Of his many books, perhaps the most influential has been <em>The Cross and the Switchblade</em>, which sparked interest about baptism in the Holy Spirit from both Protestant and Catholic circles.</p></p><h2>King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table: From Sir Thomas Malory&#39;s Le morte Darthur (The World Book treasury of classics)</h2><p>Relates the exploits of King Arthur and his knights from the birth of Arthur to the destruction of Camelot.</p><p>Retold out of the old romances, this collection of Arthurian tales endeavors to make each adventure--&#34;The Quest for the Round Table, &#34; &#34;The First Quest of Sir Lancelot, &#34; &#34;How the Holy Grail Came to Camelot, &#34; and so forth--part of a fixed pattern that effectively presents the whole story, as it does in Le Morte D&#39;Arthur, but in a way less intimidating to young readers. (All Ages)Roger Lancelyn Green was born in 1918 and lived in Oxford and at his family home in Cheshire, which the Greens had owned for more than 900 years. He loved storytelling and was fascinated by traditional fairy tales, myths and legends from around the world. He was a professional actor, a librarian and a teacher. His retellings include Egyptian, Greek and Norse legends, plus a retelling of Robin Hood. He also wrote many books for adults, including a biography of his friend C. S. Lewis, creator of the The Chronicles of Narnia. Roger Lancelyn Green died in 1987.</p><h2>JLA/Avengers</h2><p>The most powerful characters in two universes collide as DC&#39;s premier super-heroes meet Marvel&#39;s. Collected in a gorgeous two-volume oversized slipcased hardcover is perhaps the most eagerly anticipated and memorable crossover of all time, as the Justice League of America unites with The Avengers. Superman, Batman, and the other members of the JLA join forces with Captain America, Iron Man, and the many other Avengers to fight a threat so immense it threatens two entire dimensions. The second hardcover in this deluxe set features art and articles chronicling this historic crossover--which has been over twenty years in the making.</p><p>Kurt Busiek has written comics for decades, including a legendary run on The Avengers. His other work includes writing for Darkman, The Hulk, Iron Man, Green Lantern and Untold Tales of Spider-Man. George Perez has drawn The Avengers, Crisis on Infinite Earths, The Fantastic Four, Flash, JLA, New Teen Titans and Wonder Woman.</p><h2>Mahabharata</h2><p>Margaret Simpson&#39;s retelling of The Mahabharata, the five-thousand-year-old Hindu epic, is a breathtaking read full of fantastic characters. There are the valliant panavas themselves, and their ruthless and scheming cousins, the Karuravas, who will stop at nothing in their desperate fight for the kingdom. But the Mahabharata is also a Holy Book. Lord Krishna is watching over all, and a deeper meaning runs through the adventure. &#34;By offering a different and higher perspective from which to view life, the stories of The Mahabharata help us to make sense of existence - from the horrors of the news bulletin to the secrets of our hearts.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Price of Malice: A Joe Gunther Novel (Joe Gunther Series)</h2><p><p>Joe Gunther's Vermont Bureau of Investigation team is plenty busy trying to solve the grisly murder of Wayne Castine, a suspected child predator who's got mob ties in the area. But Gunther has other pressing, more personal business to attend to: the old case of his girlfriend Lyn Silva's father and brother. Fishermen both, they were once believed to be lost at sea. Until today...</p><p>With the Castine investigation in full swing, now is hardly the time for Gunther to go AWOL and join Lyn in Maine. But as more evidence emerges, the less it seems that the Silvas were innocent victims. Turns out they had some involvement with a gang of vicious smugglers--men who will do whatever it takes to keep Lyn and Gunther from finding the truth...and who will kill to keep old secrets buried.</p></p><p><p><b>"THE BEST POLICE-PROCEDURAL SERIES IN AMERICA."&#x2015;<i>Chicago</i><i> Tribune</i></b> </p><p>Joe Gunther's Vermont Bureau of Investigation team is plenty busy trying to solve the grisly murder of Wayne Castine, a suspected child predator who's got mob ties in the area.

International in scope, it covers in detail the efforts, particularly during the past two centuries, to serve the spiritual and moral needs of seafarers.

It assesses the full impact of the Middle Passage -- &#34;the most traumatizing mass human migration in modern history&#34; -- and of North American slavery both on the enslaved and on those who enslaved them. It explores the ways in which a nominally free society perverted its own freedoms and denied the fact that an inhuman institution lies at the heart of the American experience. The authority and eloquence of this work make it essential reading for all who want to understand the American past and present.</p><p>This classic work of scholarship and empathy tells the story of the self-creation of the African-American people.

Now, some thirty years later, Shank, retired and widowed, is giving up his large rambling Victorian house to his grandson Matt, whom he helped raise.</p><p>Jennifer Hillier is the author of two previous novels, Creep and Freak.

Graffiti covered the old brick walls and the front doors were badly in need of a new coat of paint. Most of the windows&#x2014;the ones that weren&#x2019;t broken&#x2014;had mismatched bedsheets as curtains, and the courtyard in front of the building looked and smelled like a garbage dump.<br> <br>The light Seattle rain drizzled down steadily, covering Captain Edward Shank&#x2019;s face with a fine mist that felt good. Twenty feet away from the apartment&#x2019;s entrance, he stood still in the dark, feeling secure, if a little warm, under the weight of the Kevlar vest hugging his torso. Several other police officers flanked him on either side, and though they weren&#x2019;t touching, he could feel the tension in their bodies cutting through the cool night air.<br> <br>He spoke to them in a low, commanding voice and gripped his weapon tighter. &#x201c;Nobody moves till I move.&#x201d;<br> <br>The only light in the area was weak and yellow, seeping from a bare bulb over the doorway to the building. A striped cat with missing patches of fur moved quietly through the shadows and into the walkway light, pausing to sniff the air. The front door to the apartment building opened and the cat scampered away. A middle-aged man, potbellied and wearing a too-tight wifebeater-style tank top and a pair of saggy denim shorts, stepped out.<br> <br>Edward Shank moved forward, aiming his weapon at the man&#x2019;s chest. &#x201c;Rufus Wedge!&#x201d; His voice, strong and authoritative, carried easily into the quiet night. &#x201c;This is Captain Edward Shank from the Seattle Police Department. Don&#x2019;t move. You&#x2019;re under arrest. Get on your knees and place your hands in the air.&#x201d;<br> <br>Startled, Wedge turned in the direction of Edward&#x2019;s voice. His left hand crept toward his back pocket.<br> <br>Without hesitation, Edward fired. So did the four other police officers beside him.<br> <br>The gunfire propelled Rufus Wedge backward. The man hit the door hard before slumping to the ground, bright spots of blood immediately appearing in several places across his torso, stark against the white cotton of his shirt. The man&#x2019;s grizzled jaw went slack, the few stray hairs from his comb-over falling across his pink, shiny forehead in moist wisps. As the light went out of his eyes, the dull yellow bulb above him cast a golden, almost angelic glow on his face.<br> <br>An interesting contradiction. Edward almost felt guilty.<br> <br>Almost.<br> <br>&#x201c;We got him, Captain,&#x201d; someone said. Edward recognized the voice but didn&#x2019;t turn to look. He couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to take his eyes off Rufus Wedge, so he nodded without averting his gaze. &#x201c;We finally nailed the Butcher. Thank fucking Christ.&#x201d;<br> <br>From somewhere in the dark, the striped cat yowled.<br> <br>The officers around Edward rushed forward to check the man&#x2019;s vitals, as was protocol, guns still drawn. Their captain stayed behind, unmoving, under the cover of the darkness, his eyes fixed on Wedge&#x2019;s dead body.<br> <br>Rufus Wedge, otherwise known as the Beacon Hill Butcher, had been the most wanted man in the Pacific Northwest for a long time. The manhunt was now over.<br> <br>Holstering his weapon, Edward let out a long, slow breath. Wiping his brow, slick from the rain, he stepped forward into the light toward the dead man. Wedge stared up at him with blank, glossy eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;No more now,&#x201d; Edward said quietly. He wasn&#x2019;t speaking to anyone in particular, except maybe himself. &#x201c;No more.&#x201d;</p><h2>Rodin and America: Influence and Adaptation 1876-1936</h2><p>The sculptor and his influence on American Art</p><p></p><h2>Porsche 928: 1977-1996 (The Essential Buyer&#39;s Guide)</h2><p>A small investment in this book could save you a fortune.

A unique point system will help you to place the car&#39;s value in relation to condition. This is an important investment-don&#39;t buy a car without this book&#39;s help.</p><p>Written from a background of 30 years continuous ownership of Porsches from a 914 to 911s and 928s. The author has also been a guiding member of Porsche Club Great Britain throughout this time and, therefore, writing about the cars, and 928s in particular, was a natural and easy progression. There cannot be many details to have escaped his attention: this book allows them all to be shared with a much wider readership.</p><h2>Paleozoic Fossils (Schiffer Book for Collectors)</h2><p>Explore the rich fossil record of the Paleozoic Era, from the Cambrian (545 million years ago) through the Permian (almost 300 million years ago) with 650 high quality color photos and detailed, highly readable text. Following his successful work on the earliest fossils, the author now starts at that time in earths history when life blossomed into a variety of body plans (phyla), and explores the successive periods of the Paleozoic Era. These include the Cambrian; the early, mid-, and late Ordovician; the Silurian and Devonian with their numerous marine fossils and some of the earths first land plants and early fish; the diverse land plants and peculiar marine life of the Carboniferous (Mississippian and Pennsylvanian periods); and the fossils of the Permian, including many fossils of life forms that would go extinct in the worlds greatest extinction event.\nThis is a great book for fossil hunters of all ilks and anyone interested in the early remnants of life. Those who collect or trade fossils will find a useful guide to the values of the fossils.</p><p>Bruce Stinchcomb has a Ph.D. in geology from the University of Missouri-Rolla and is retired professor of geology at St. Louis Community College.

The author, a former member of the curatorial staff of the Smithsonian Institution&#x2019;s Division of Transportation, has carefully selected detailed engravings of the period, many from rare trade periodicals in the collection of the Smithsonian, as well as photographs. Well-researched captions accompany the illustrations, focusing on how the design of each vehicle served its specific purposes and needs, and supplying various dimensions, coloring, and other details. The author has also written an engrossing historical introduction that sharply defines the development of commercial vehicles in an age of headlong expansion and industrial advancement.<br>Invaluable for anyone interested in antique transportation, this volume is also an ideal source of royalty-free illustrations for use in ads, catalogs, book and magazine illustrations, and elsewhere.<br></p><p></p><h2>Literary Trails: British Writers in Their Landscapes</h2><p>Under nine different themes, Hardyment traces the many literary associations of famous writers with locations in Great Britain. Combined with descriptions of each place, the author provides information on how get to each one using all modes of transport.</p><p></p><h2>Little House Reader, A</h2><p><p><strong>Laura Ingalls Wilder</strong> was a writer long before she ever recorded the adventures of her pioneer childhood in the beloved Little House books. As a young girl she wrote poetry, and after marrying Almanzo and moving to the Ozark Mountains, she became a journalist, publishing articles on farming and the life of a farmwife. This moving collection pieces together a unique medley of Laura's writings from the time before her Little House books. These writings, culled mostly from fragile and yellowed pieces of paper, offer a window into Laura's day-to-day life and experiences, giving us a richer understanding of the woman and writer famed for her Little House books. </p></p><p><p>Laura Ingalls Wilder was born in 1867 in the log cabin described in <em>Little House in the Big Woods</em>. She and her family traveled by covered wagon across the Midwest. Later, Laura and her husband, Almanzo Wilder, made their own covered-wagon trip with their daughter, Rose, to Mansfield, Missouri. There, believing in the importance of knowing where you began in order to appreciate how far you've come, Laura wrote about her childhood growing up on the American frontier. For millions of readers Laura lives on forever as the little pioneer girl in the beloved Little House books.</p><br><br><p>Dan Andreasen has illustrated many well-loved books for children, including <em>River Boy: The Story of Mark Twain</em> and <em>Pioneer Girl: The Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder</em>, both by William Anderson, as well as many titles in the Little House series. He lives with his family in Medina, Ohio.</p>Anderson (A Little House Sampler, 1989, not reviewed, etc.) has collected occasional pieces, essays, and poems from Laura Ingalls Wilder's personal papers, written by her and by several members of her family, into a volume that shows how she ``bridged the gap from the henhouse to the publishing house,'' and that explores her social, philosophical, and religious ideas. Grouping selections thematically and decorating them with homey family photos, Anderson then cements the pieces with lengthy introductions that both fill in background as well as add links to the novels. His tone is often more earnest than Wilder's, whose juvenile verse--``I will leave this frozen region/I will travel further south/If you say one word against it/I will hit you in the mouth''--and broadly rustic characters (e.g., in a much later account of how the jail in Mansfield was burnt and rebuilt) have lost none of their humor. With few exceptions, everything here is either unpublished or appeared in local newspapers; fans of any age will find these reflections on a wide range of topics thoroughly enjoyable--and the prose and poetry from Wilder's mother and father, her three sisters, and daughter, a pleasant lagniappe.

A contemporary said this about his ministry:<br><br>'There are some perhaps who are more popular among the ordinary people, but there is no one with a purer gospel or who understands it better. He does not depend on voice or gesture. He has no silver trumpet or triple harp, but he has a speech live enough to cause excitement among the bones.'<br><br>He served churches in Dowlais, Ystalyfera, Treforest and, for 37 years, in Pembroke Terrace, Cardiff. For the last fourteen years of his life he was the superintendent of his denomination's 'Forward Movement', an organization formed to evangelize and build churches for the new masses of industrial workers that had moved into south-east Wales at the close of the nineteenth century.<br><br>Jones published various commentaries and biographies in Welsh, and innumerable articles. Much of his work had to do with contending against the rising tide of higher criticism. Through his biographical labours he realized that much of the early history of his denomination would soon be lost if it were not collected and published. Together therefore with his friend, William Morgan, he set about researching what was to become the two volumes of Y Tadau Methodistaidd.<strong>*</strong><br><br>Because of his awareness of the importance of the Trefeca letters and journals, John Morgan Jones served as chairman of the committee formed in 1909 to facilitate their publication, and this committee led in turn to the formation of the Calvinistic Methodist Historical Society in 1914. He served as chairman of its committee from 1915 until his death in 1921. He was twice appointed Moderator of the General Assembly of his denomination in 1897 and 1920.<br><br><strong>*Published in English translation (by John Aaron) by the Trust as The Calvinistic Methodist Fathers of Wales.</strong></p><h2>Freedom From Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Personalized Recovery Program For Living With Uncertainty</h2><p>Draws on the author&#39;s work at the Philadelphia Anxiety and Agoraphobia Treatment Center to discuss the exercises and activities that have enabled his patients to make breakthroughs in coping with their disorders, outlining a self-guided version of the program that blends multiple treatment avenues and focuses on relapse prevention and recovery. 17,500 first printing.</p><p>Jonathan Grayson, Ph.D., is the director of the Anxiety and Agoraphobia Treatment Center and an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Temple University Medical School.

She teaches English at the University of Maryland extension at a U.S. Air Force base near Venice Italy, where she has lived for over twenty years.<br><br>David Colacci has been an actor and a director for over thirty years, and has worked as a narrator for over fifteen years. He has won AudioFile Earphones Awards, earned Audie nominations, and been included in Best of Year lists by such publications as Publishers Weekly, AudioFile magazine, and Library Journal.As if Brunetti weren&#x2019;t already steaming about the mindless, atavistic greed&#x2019; motivating everything from the shabby practices of the banking industry to the irresponsible dredging of the Grand Canal, Leon hits him with a crime that really tries his soul So he takes his pleasures where he can at home with his family, in his favorite coffee bars and on long walks around Venice but after this case, the city he loves will never be quite the same for him.&#x201d; Marilyn Stasio, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> Followers of the series and lovers of Venice will appreciate Leon&#x2019;s fascinating details of life in this unique city. This is a strong series entry.&#x201d; Dan Forrest, <i>Library Journal</i><br><br> Through the 21 novels in her much-loved Guido Brunetti series, Leon has tackled various social issues, from human trafficking through immigration policy and sexual abuse, always with great sensitivity toward not only the criminal aspects of the issue but also the more ambiguous toll that societal malfunction takes on individual lives. So it is again in this wrenching tale of the murder of a quiet veterinarian, the victim of a tragedy of almost classical dimensions. A seemingly straightforward mystery written with such delicacy and emotional force that we can&#x2019;t help but be reminded of Greek tragedy.&#x201d; Bill Ott, <i>Booklist</i> (starred review)<br><br>"It is a pleasure for a reader to settle in to one of Donna Leon's Commissario Guido Brunetti mysteries, once again to have one of those glorious Italian lunches with his wife, Paola, and their children, Raffi and Chiara, and to learn, as we do in Beastly Things, which part of the seamy underside of Venetian life Brunetti will now uncover. ...This time, a body is found in one of the canals. It is eventually identified as a local veterinarian, Dottore Nava, well-loved by his patients and their owners. ... The way Brunetti figures out what happened and who killed Nava is first-rate Donna Leon plotting." Valerie Ryan, Shelf Awareness<br><br> <i>Beastly Things</i>, Donna Leon&#x2019;s 21st Commissario Guido Brunetti series set in Venice, doesn&#x2019;t disappoint. All her trademark strengths shine in this swiftly paced, sophisticated tale of greed versus ethics.&#x201d; Irene Wanner, <i>The Seattle Times</i><br><br> [A] fine atmospheric novel Twenty-one books on, she has lost none of her delightful skill and wit.&#x201d; Mark Sanderson, <i>Evening Mail</i> (UK)<br><br>"The latest Commissario Guido Brunetti Venetian police procedural is a super whodunit... Brunetti and Vianello are marvelous as they piece together clues mostly using old fashion shoe leather but also ably supported by the IT gurus Signorina Elettra and Pucetti." -<i>The Midwest Book Review</i><br><br>"Brunetti is, as always, a canny commentator on Italian culture... However, it is in the poignant closing scene... where Leon's singular talents truly shine." -<i>Book Page</i><br><br>"What a pleasure it is to greet Guido Brunetti... a man comfortable in his own skin, complete with quirks, foibles, and all... But, as in many of Leon's stories, the procedural is a stepping stone to bigger problems undermining the magic of Venice: venality and greed, flourishing as ever." -<i>Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br> Like Dorothy Sayers&#x2019;s Lord Peter Wimsey in the 1930s, Guido Brunetti has accumulated depth and subtlety book by book. In Beastly Things he learns, the hard way, unpleasant facts about the meat industry that have long since made vegetarians of his daughter and Inspector Vianello. Leon has never written a more powerful sequence than the chapter in Beastly Things where Brunetti and Vianello visit a busy slaughterhouse. Set, as always, against the living background of Venice itself, and the family background that keeps Brunetti&#x2019;s moral compass straight while letting him enjoy good food, wine, and loving support, Beastly Things is a quietly satisfying celebration of the series&#x2019;s twenty-first birthday. Long may it continue.&#x201d; Peter Green, <i>The New Republic</i><br><br> Brunetti&#x2019;s challenges make for scintillating reading.&#x201d; Randy Dotinga, <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br>"One of the most attractive serial detectives of contemporary fiction. ... The unravelling of this intricate plot is very satisfying, yet the real pleasure of this novel lies in its evocation of a city whose shimmering beauty is set against the encroaching predations of the Mafia; a city where proper jobs are so rare that most young adults live at home with their parents, studying or wasting time; a place where your only real safety comes from having, say, four Doges in your ancestry, or a father with such powerful influence that nobody dares cross him."

Gaddis anticipates by almost half a century the crisis of reality that we currently face, where the real and the virtual are combining in alarming ways, and the sources of legitimacy and power are often obscure to us.</p></p><p>William Gaddis (1922-98) stands among the greatest American writers of the twentieth century. The winner of two National Book Awards (for &#34;J R&#34; [1976] and &#34;A Frolic of His Own&#34; [1995]), he wrote five novels during his lifetime, including &#34;Carpenter&#39;s Gothic &#34;(1985), &#34;Agap? Agape&#34; (published posthumously in 2002), and his early masterpiece &#34;The Recognitions&#34; (1955). He is loved and admired for his stylistic innovations, his unforgettable characters, his pervasive humor, and the breadth of his intellect and vision."The novel is like a huge landscape painting of modern New York, peopled with hundreds of doomed but energetic little figures, executed on wood panels by Brueghel or Bosch, and looking incongruously ancient beneath layers of yellowed lacquer. Even the blue skies in the book (the phrase "Another blue day" recurs as a despair-inducing leitmotiv) glow like oil-paint skies in an art museum..." (<i>Jonathan Franzen, The New Yorker</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Recognitions</i> is always spoken of as the most overlooked important work of the last several literary generations... Through the famous obscurity of <i>The Recognitions</i>, Mr. Gaddis has become famous for not being famous enough." (<i>Cynthia Ozick</i>)<br><br>"[<i>The Recognitions</i>] seems as relevant as ever. For who would dare say that we no longer live in a world in which people 'exchange forgeries of what the heart dare not surrender?' The problem of authenticity in all its forms is always with us, and in reading this extraordinary book we are constantly freed into recognitions &#x2015; re-cognitions &#x2015; of many aspects, of the problem, which have deteriorated into non-cognitions in our mass media age. William Gaddis detects forgery at all levels, but in doing so he has forged a classic."

Although the book opens with a scary scene--a family is stabbed to death by "a man named Jack&#x201d; --the story quickly moves into more child-friendly storytelling. The sole survivor of the attack--an 18-month-old baby--escapes his crib and his house, and toddles to a nearby graveyard. Quickly recognizing that the baby is orphaned, the graveyard's ghostly residents adopt him, name him Nobody ("Bod"), and allow him to live in their tomb. Taking inspiration from Kipling&#x2019;s <i>The Jungle Book</i>, Gaiman describes how the toddler navigates among the headstones, asking a lot of questions and picking up the tricks of the living and the dead. In serial-like episodes, the story follows Bod's progress as he grows from baby to teen, learning life&#x2019;s lessons amid a cadre of the long-dead, ghouls, witches, intermittent human interlopers. A pallid, nocturnal guardian named Silas ensures that Bod receives food, books, and anything else he might need from the human world. Whenever the boy strays from his usual play among the headstones, he finds new dangers, learns his limitations and strengths, and acquires the skills he needs to survive within the confines of the graveyard and in wider world beyond.

The boys have committed a horrifying act, caught on CCTV. They remain unidentified - except by their parents. How far will each couple go to protect their child?</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, February 2013</strong><strong>:</strong> A good unreliable narrator is one of the most satisfying characters a novelist can dream up--and Herman Koch takes us on a hell of a ride through the mind of Paul Lohman, the deliciously sinister host of <em>The Dinner</em>. Paul's 15-year-old son, Michel, has committed an unspeakable crime; his brother, on the cusp of becoming the Netherlands' next prime minister, has a delicate wife and two teenagers who share Michel&#x2019;s secret; Paul's wife, Claire, will do anything to protect their boy. As the two couples inch through an excruciating meal at a chic restaurant--their children's whereabouts uncertain--Paul peels back the layers of their situation, weaving to and fro through time and truth. Koch's finely structured story gives away just enough on each page to keep us riveted, feeling like private investigators on the verge of discovery, until the shock of an ending. It's no small feat for the author that the less we trust Paul, the more we want to hear what he has to say. --<em>Mia Lipman</em>Herman Koch, born in 1953, is a Dutch writer. He was a renowned television actor on the series Jiskefet and a former columnist for the newspaper Volkskrant. The Dinner is his sixth novel and has already won the prestigious Publieksprijs Prize in 2009.

Edited and with an interview of the author by Mark Nowak. With excerpts from or entire republications of 24 of Theodore Enslin&#39;s books spanning 50 years of writing, this volume provides an outstanding portrait of a life dedicated to poetry, through the poetry itself. &#34;Seldom does Enslin use or recall nature as a metaphor; what he usually does is walk through it. He knows it in the way that the city dweller might know the city...For me this is the central and unique power of Theodore Enslin&#39;s poetry: he continues to try to articulate clearly those things that are the very ground of human experience&#34;--Toby Olson. &#34;Quiet revolves in the tick of a clock / not the time arbitrary / it releases into something / else the actual / it dies away. (from Part Songs, 1987) The poems are delightful, the interview informative, the book a must for anyone interested in Enslin.</p><p>6 x 9 trim.

Through their creativity and celebrated hospitality, they initiated a salon culture in their great country houses in the Delaware Valley. In this stunningly original and heavily illustrated book, Susan M. Stabile shows that these female writers sought to memorialize their lives and aesthetic experience&#x2015;a purpose that stands in marked contrast to the civic concerns of male authors in the republican era.</p><p>Drawing equally on material culture and literary history, Stabile discusses how the group used their writings to explore and at times replicate the arrangement of their material possessions, including desks, writing paraphernalia, mirrors, miniatures, beds, and coffins. As she reconstructs the poetics of memory that informed the women's lives and structured their manuscripts, Stabile focuses on vernacular architecture, penmanship, souvenir collecting, and mourning.</p><p>Empirically rich and nuanced in its readings of different kinds of artifacts, this engaging work tells of the erasure of the women's lives from the national memory as the feminine aesthetic of scribal publication was overshadowed by the proliferating print culture of late eighteenth-century America.</p></p><p><p>Susan M. Stabile is Associate Professor of English at Texas A&amp;M University. Her articles have appeared in several scholarly journals.</p><p>"Susan M. Stabile has given us a great gift: a sense of the world inhabited by America's first constellation of literary women. Her abandonment of chronology and disinclination to introduce any sort of narrative of development are a challenge to traditional historians. Instead, they force one into the perspective of the persons she is treating.

It is said its relevance is limited to explaining individuals&#x2019; economic conditions and opportunities, while at the same time argued that it is a structural feature of macro-power relations. In <i>Understanding Class</i>, leading left sociologist Erik Olin Wright interrogates the divergent meanings of this fundamental concept in order to develop a more integrated framework of class analysis. Beginning with the treatment of class in Marx and Weber, proceeding through the writings of Charles Tilly, Thomas Piketty, Guy Standing, and others, and finally examining how class struggle and class compromise play out in contemporary society, <i>Understanding Class</i> provides a compelling view of how to think about the complexity of class in the world today.</p><p><b>Erik Olin Wright</b> is Vilas Distinguished Professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin.

Helen and William Bynum are expert guides to the rich histories, significance and uses of over 80 key plants in 69 entries, revealing our relationship with them, both utilitarian and aesthetic, and their multiple benefits and cultural associations. Organized thematically, eight sections cover all aspects of our interaction with plants starting with those crops that were fundamental to the development of cultures and civilizations, and those that enliven our diet beyond the basics, such as saffron and chilli peppers. Other sections look at plants that have helped to create our material world, as well as those that are used medicinally or are revered and adored for symbolic reasons, including the tulip, the rose and the lotus.

The first develops a sophisticated approach to negotiation for executives, attorneys, diplomats -- indeed, for anyone who bargains or studies its challenges. The second offers a new and compelling vision of the successful manager: as a strong, often subtle negotiator, constantly shaping agreements and informal understandings throughout the complex web of relationships in an organization.<p>Effective managers must be able to reach good formal accords such as contracts, out-of-court settlements, and joint venture agreements. Yet they also have to negotiate with others on whom they depend for results, resources, and authority. Whether getting fuller support from the marketing department, hammering out next year's budget, or winning the approval for a new line of business, managers must be adept at advantageously working out and modifying understandings, resolving disputes, and finding mutual gains where interests and perceptions conflict. In such situations, <i>The Manager as Negotiator</i> shows how to creatively further the totality of one's interests, including important relationships -- in a way that Richard Walton, Harvard Business School Professor of Organizational Behavior, describes as "sensitive to the nuances of negotiating in organizations" and "relentless and skillful in making systematic sense of the process."</p><p>This book differs fundamentally from the recent spate of negotiation handbooks that tend to espouse one of two approaches: the competitive ("Get yours and most of theirs, too") or the cooperative ("Everyone can always win"). Transcending such cynical and naive views, the authors develop a comprehensive approach, based on strategies and tactics for productively managing the tension between the cooperation and competition that are both inherent in bargaining.</p><p>Based on the authors' extensive experience with hundreds of cases, and peppered with a number of wide-ranging examples, <i>The Manager as Negotiator</i> will be invaluable to novice and experienced negotiators, public and private managers, academics, and anyone who needs to know the state of the art in this important field.</p><p></p></p><p><b>David A. Lax</b> is founder and co-director of the Negotiation Roundtable at the Harvard Business School. An Assistant Professor of Business Administration there, he teaches an extremely popular negotiation course. Educated at Princeton and at Harvard, from which he holds a doctorate in statistics, he has written extensively on negotiation. As a principal of The Negotiation Group, Professor Lax frequently acts as a consultant to business and governments. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>The Manager as Negotiator</b> </p><p> Negotiating is a way of life for managers, whether renting office space, coaxing a scarce part from another division, building support for a new marketing plan, or working out next year's budget. In these situations and thousands like them, some interests conflict. People disagree. And they negotiate to find a form of joint action that seems better to each than the alternatives. </p><p> Despite its importance, the negotiation process is often misunderstood and badly carried out. Inferior agreements result, if not endless bickering, needless deadlock, or spiraling conflict. In this book, we diagnose the causes of these problems, show how they infect negotiations, and point the way to superior outcomes. </p><p> Virtually everyone accepts the importance of bargaining to sell a building, resolve a toxic waste dispute, acquire a small exploration company, or handle like situations. Yet negotiation goes well beyond such encounters and their most familiar images: smoke-filled rooms, firm proposals, urgent calls to headquarters, midnight deadlines, and binding contracts. Though far less recognized, much the same process is involved when managers deal with their superiors, boards of directors, even legislators. Managers negotiate with those whom they cannot command but whose cooperation is vital, including peers and others outside the chain of command or beyond the organization itself. Managers even negotiate with subordinates who often have their own interests, understandings, sources of support, and areas of discretion. </p><p> In a static world, agreements once made generally endure. Yet change calls on organizations to adapt. And rapid changes call for new arrangements to be envisioned, negotiated, and renegotiated among those who know the situation best and will have to work with the results. </p><p> Certainly negotiation is a useful skill for important occasions, but it also lies at the core of the manager's job. Managers negotiate not only to win contracts, but also to guide enterprises in the face of change. Our task in this book is to show why this is so and how it can be done better. </p><p> Thus we develop a special logic for negotiators, useful inside the organization and out. It is an ambitious agenda, one that we now introduce by describing a manager's continuing efforts to settle a lawsuit. Once we discuss the dilemma that trapped Les Winston in his negotiation with an "outside" party, we focus back "inside" the organization. There, the negotiations that occupy managers' lives run up against versions of the same dilemma. </p><p> <b>Les Winston's Dilemma</b> </p><p> Metallurgist Les Winston was sharing a drink with his old friend Tom, a noted analyst of negotiations. Les described his ongoing ordeal trying to settle a suit brought against him by the Ammetal Corp., his former employer. If Ammetal won in court, Les's two-year-old company would be forced down from its high-flying course into bankruptcy. And their latest settlement demand -- for <i>half</i> of his firm's revenues during the next ten years -- seemed ruinous. Concerned, Tom pressed for details. </p><p> Les had joined Ammetal just after graduate school and had happily worked in their labs and testing facilities for the next nine years. Happily, that is, until he had a strong hunch that a new process might reduce production costs for an important specialty alloy, whose market Ammetal now dominated. While his boss had not forbidden him to work on this process, he had given Les no resources for it and had loaded him down with other tasks. Still, Les had devoted all his spare time to following up his hunch at home. Soon he was convinced that he had solved the problem and excitedly showed his results to his boss -- who again seemed unimpressed, dismissing Les's work as "inconclusive." In fact he urged Les to forget the whole thing since, in his judgment, the only improvement worth making required a radically different process that no one, including Les, thought had better than a one-in-thirty chance of ever working. </p><p> That did it. Though Les really liked his colleagues and most of his job at Ammetal, especially the research, he quit to start his own firm, scraping together capital from relatives and borrowing heavily from one large backer. Eighteen months later, the modest plant that he had adapted for his process had more orders than it could handle. Best of all, Les was absolutely certain that he had just cracked the secret of the radically different process, which could, with several months of development, slash current production costs by more than half. Though he currently enjoyed about a 20 percent cost advantage over Ammetal, this new knowledge should eventually permit him to push his former employer completely out of the market. </p><p> So he was stunned to read an announcement one morning that Ammetal planned to build a large plant that obviously would use the process currently in place in his plant. (It was nearly impossible to protect such processes by patent; secrecy was the only hope.) Les was further dismayed that same day to learn that Ammetal had filed suit to enjoin <i>him</i> from further using his process. They alleged that he had violated his employment contract with them, improperly using results from his work in the Ammetal labs. When his lawyer examined his old contract and gave him only a fifty-fifty chance of a successful defense, Les's spirits sagged. It did not cheer him at all that his lawyer argued -- and had also heard informally from an old partner who worked in Ammetal's legal department -- that the other side could expect no more than even odds of winning a case like this. </p><p> Five months into this discouraging episode, Les had decided that some form of negotiated settlement could protect him against the chance of losing the case, avoid further legal costs, lessen his anxiety, and free him to spend his time helping his business to grow. He had initially offered Ammetal a 3 percent royalty for the next three years, and had gradually raised his offer to 15 percent during the next five years. (This was about equal to the highest royalty rate in the industry for an analogous, but friendly, licensing agreement.) But Ammetal was miles away, insisting at first on 60 percent indefinitely, and now, on a "rock-bottom final" demand of 50% for the next decade. There they had deadlocked, with the trial only a week hence. </p><p> With an air of resignation, Les finished his recitation and said to Tom, "So, that is how we stand, and all I can see is doing my damndest to increase the odds of winning that suit. Otherwise,..."his voice trailed off as he rolled his eyes back and sliced across his neck with his forefinger. "Except, of course, that I'll eventually recover, pick up the pieces, put together a new organization, and blow them out of the water when I get the new process going. It might even be fun, watching them write off their big new plant, which will suddenly become obsolete. But what a price for revenge!" </p><p> Tom registered all this, then leaned forward and asked Les to describe what he would <i>really</i> like to come out of it. A bit taken aback, Les thought and replied, slowly, "Well, I would really like to be left alone to continue with the current process, until the new one is perfected. That, however, will take some months and I'd need to raise a lot of money. Actually, Tom," he continued meditatively, "it may sound a little strange after all Ammetal has done, but I would most enjoy working on this new process with my good friends in the lab there -- and not have to worry about all the financing and logistics and administrative headaches of running my own show. Ammetal's manufacturing and distribution networks are first class once they've got a good product. Of course, I don't want to give up the money, quite a fortune really, that would come from doing it myself. Also, freedom feels very good, especially after dealings with that jerk of a boss." </p><p> "So why not propose a joint venture?" Tom queried. </p><p> "In fact," Les replied, "I suggested just that to Albert Laxel [a social acquaintance and senior VP at Ammetal]. I ran across him playing tennis last weekend and told him how sick I was of this whole miserable thing, how I wished they would just drop the suit and forget their new plant, which they'd end up regretting anyway., I finished by tossing out the idea of jointly commercializing my new process -- on the right terms, of course. He seemed sympathetic, especially about my old R&amp;D boss, who's been on everyone's nerves for a while, who championed their newly announced alloy venture -- and who undoubtedly instigated the suit against me. </p><p> "Still, Albert dismissed my idea out of hand, saying something about how this episode must be taking a real toll on me. Otherwise, why would I make such an obvious bluff about discovering the new process -- which no one could take seriously, especially given my current fix, and how remote everyone, including me, had judged the odds of its working. </p><p> "The only way to convince Ammetal, would be to actually show them the new work -- which there's a snowball's chance in hell of my doing now, just so they could steal it, too. The irony of all this," Les continued, "is that we would both be better off if they didn't sink a ton of money into a useless plant and if I could do only what I want with the new process -- with no extraneous business stuff -- and yet still profit handsomely from it." </p><p> Tom thought for a moment, and then intoned professorially, "Well, Les, maybe it wouldn't be so hard to persuade them that you have the new process and that they should think again." With Les's full attention now, Tom continued, "Why not drop your current position and better their demand for 50% of your revenues? Why not just offer them a 60% royalty on your current operation? Or really shock them by offering even more?" </p><p> Les slowly put down his drink, figuring that Tom could not possibly have been listening. "Tom, that's crazy. It wouldn't convince them of anything about my new discovery -- low or high, a royalty settlement has nothing to do with it. And why on earth would I give up my only card, the even chance I have of winning the suit? If I win, they <i>know</i> I'll stay in the industry, and that they can't go ahead with their plans. Even if I only had my current process, two plants would lead to an oversupply situation. It's a very lucrative market, but the volume is not that great. That's why they've got to knock me out through the courts. I've heard of <i>demanding</i> unconditional surrender but never <i>offering</i> it." </p><p> "Les, I understand. But that's the whole point. The 60% royalty would indeed burn your bridges with your current operation. But the only way you could possibly make such an offer is to be <i>sure</i> that the new process worked. Unless you were suicidally inclined or nuts, you would not set up a situation in which the only route left for you -- commercializing the new process -- was a dead end. So, with a little thought, Ammetal's got to realize you're telling the truth and that they shouldn't plan to build a new plant. Of course, as you enter the final round of negotiations, you should bring in an agreement to that effect for them to sign, <i>but</i> that agreement should <i>also</i> commit them to a joint venture, where you get a very big piece of the action, once," Tom looked sly, "once they offer you your old boss's job. After all, he's been the bad guy in this from the start." </p><p> Les Winston had been caught in a simple version of a central dilemma of bargaining. Devising a joint venture to benefit both parties depended on his actually having the new process. Yet directly sharing this information would open him to gross exploitation. If Les did not really have the process and yet bluffed that he did, Ammetal would be deterred from going ahead with their plans -- if they believed him. Knowing this, they would suspect any such statement from him. Les had to find a way to make his assertion credible without becoming vulnerable in doing so. </p><p> Tom's analysis suggested the means safely to untangle a self-serving bluff from a truthful signal: a seeming concession that committed Les to an action that would make sense only if he actually had the process. And this illustrates one small piece of a much broader problem with which we will grapple throughout this book: negotiators must manage the inescapable tension between cooperative moves to create value for all and competitive moves to claim value for each. </p><p> Again and again, we will find this central tension, whether in this relatively simply negotiation "outside" Les's firm or in more complex and subtle negotiations "inside" organizations -- in which building trust and relationships as well as repeated dealings figure much more prominently than they did in the end game between Les and Ammetal. </p><p> <b>Key Elements of Negotiation</b> </p><p> Virtually everyone would concur that Les "bargained" or "negotiated" to settle the suit. (We use these two terms interchangeably.) Shortly after he had rejoined Ammetal as head of the new venture, Les said, understandably, that he was relieved to have "negotiation" behind him so he "could get on with his job." By "his job", he meant working out with the CEO next year's capital budget and just how many employees would be assigned to his new project. Les meant getting the engineering and production people committed to completing the design rapidly and convincing the sales force to promote the now-cheaper alloy aggressively, even though it was only one of many products they handled. He meant talking to the accounting department to reduce some of the overhead they were allocating to his project and to modify a transfer price they had proposed for semifinished metal he would need from another division. Not to mention working out the allocation of tasks among his project team or new arrangements with his slightly edgy former peers at the R&amp;D lab, whose boss he had replaced. To us, these aspects of his job centrally involve negotiation. </p><p> Like Les, many people have much too limited a view of the negotiation process, thinking mainly of explicit, well-acknowledged examples such as merger contests or collective bargaining. Yet its key elements occur far more widely in and out of management. Consider interdependence, some perceived conflict, opportunistic potential, and the possibility of agreement -- four of the most important such elements of negotiation: </p><p> <i>Interdependence</i> When Joseph depends on Laura, he cannot achieve the results he wants as cheaply, as well, or at all without her help (if only by her not interfering). Usually, dependence among people in organizations is mutual. While the reasons for a subordinate's reliance on a boss are often obvious, superiors generally depend on subordinates as well. Reasons for this include valuable, hard-to-replace skills, specialized information, or relationships with other critical players. Think, for example, of the many ways that the chief executive depends on her long-time personal secretary. Or how the shop floor supervisor relies on the one technician who can fix a key, cranky machine. Or how a sales manager needs the field knowledge of his sales force.

He understands because he was hungry. His friends were hungry. Instead of starving to death, however, Kirvan created a spiritual feast in God Hunger, sharing what the great mystics sought and found-- a direct, love-driven way of knowing God. <p>Kirvan explores the lives and writings of ten great spiritual teachers from the 4th century to today, going far beyond the ephemeral religious fashions that flit in and out of modern popular culture, explaining the techniques they used to hear the movements of God within. With 50 meditations and prayers, God Hunger builds on the words and wisdom of the mystics-- from Gregory of Nyssa to Thomas Merton, and Kabbalah to C.S. Lewis-- sending us on our own personal quest toward God. </p><p>Prepare to be shocked. Prepare for spiritual risks. Even the most seasoned spiritual traveler will be surprised when and where they discover God. Kirvan emphasizes, however, that the journey has no bargain rates or shortcuts. Faith is a lifelong commitment, not a passing fad, an emotional pilgrimage that requires inspired devotion in an era when we have been offered so much and often settle for so little. </p><p>Combining the best of Christian, Jewish and Islamic traditions, God Hunger keeps us honest, humble, focused on the search and joyful in the discovery of a nourishing spiritual life.</p></p><p>At the root of all our longing is a profound hunger for God. It's a hunger that can't be satisfied with feel-good recipes or pious platitudes. It is, in reality, the same hunger that has for centuries motivated the world's great spiritual teachers, a hunger only God can fill.<p>Here is a book that takes this God hunger seriously by providing fifty challenging experiences for the soul built around the core spiritual insights of ten great Western mystics (Christian, Jewish, and Islamic).</p><p>Crossing centuries and traditions, it takes the searcher on a journey of discovery of the very best that Western spirituality has to offer. It leads the reader on an accessible path from the Islamic poet Rumi in the thirteenth century to the monk and mystic Thomas Merton in the twentieth, from Gregory of Nyssa in the fourth century to the Kaballah in the twelfth, and on to C. S. Lewis and Evelyn Underhill, mystics of our time who often did their teaching on the BBC.</p>John Kirvan, who died in 2012, wrote primarily about classical spirituality. He conceived the 30 Days with a Great Spiritual Teacher series and edited most of its seventeen titles. Kirvan s other books include God Hunger, Silent Hope, Raw Faith, and There Is a God, There Is No God.</p><h2>A Nation Forsaken: EMP: The Escalating Threat of an American Catastrophe</h2><p><p>There have been warnings from scientists and other experts for years that the Nation's electrical grid system and other critical infrastructures that have almost complete dependency on electricity and electronic components are highly vulnerable to an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) event either from natural or man-made causes.</p><p>However, Congress and the administrations of previous and current presidents largely have ignored those warnings. Events such as the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States and then the devastating Hurricane Katrina that revealed vulnerabilities to those infrastructures heightened that concern. Due to the lapse of time and a relatively calm period since those disasters, policymakers have been lulled back into complacency rather than take preventative action against what could be the biggest threat to US national and economic security in our lifetime.</p><p>The threat from an EMP attack on our critical infrastructures either from an impending solar storm of serious intensity &#x2013; expected between 2012 and 2014 &#x2013; or a high-altitude nuclear explosion are threats that could have long-term catastrophic consequences for our society and our way of life.</p><p>In 2008 a congressional commission studied the consequences of an EMP attack not only the power grid itself but also the consequences to every sector of our economy: telecommunications, banking, transportation, food, manufacturing, construction, and energy.</p><p>While these critical infrastructures continue to face such an impending crisis, Congress has basically ignored its own commission report and instead has treated the threat of an EMP event as a political football to be punted whenever expedient for their own gain. To date, still nothing has been done to protect the nation.</p><p>Michael Maloof breaks down that threat in his book A Nation Forsaken. He even outlines how our own military is similarly vulnerable to an EMP event due to its 99 percent dependency on the nation's electrical grid system for electricity and communications, raising the high prospect that it may not be able to function to defend the nation in its time of greatest need.</p><p>While an EMP event on our civilian infrastructure could be serious, it can be managed if government at the federal, state, and local levels gives a high priority to undertake preventative action to lessen its impact to recover from such an event. Now is the time for Congress to act and stop forsaking our nation.&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>F. Michael Maloof</b>, a former senior security policy analyst in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, has almost 30 years of federal service in the U.S. Defense Department and as a specialized trainer for border guards and Special Forces in select countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia. While with the Department of Defense, Maloof was Director of Technology Security Operations as head of a 10-person team involved in halting the diversion of militarily-critical technologies to countries of national security and proliferation concern and those involved in sponsoring terrorism. His office was the liaison to the intelligence and enforcement community within the Office of the Secretary of Defense in halting diversions and using cases that developed from them as early warnings to decision-makers of potential policy issues. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the United States, Maloof was detailed back to report directly to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy to prepare analysis of worldwide terrorist networks, determine their linkages worldwide and their relationship to state sponsors. Prior to his career at the Defense Department, Maloof was a legislative assistant to various U.S. Senators specializing in national security and international affairs. In between working at the U.S. Senate and the Defense Department, Maloof was a special Washington correspondent for The Detroit News, a reporter for a specialized newsletter at U.S. News &amp; World Report and Washington correspondent for The Union Leader in Manchester, NH.

It includes 120 color images from Barney's film work, as well as the studies that went into them. Three enlightening texts round out this compact publication: Luc Steels is a scientist specializing in artificial intelligence; Shin'Ichi Nakazawa is a theologist and folklorist; and Itsuko Hasegawa weighs in with a curatorial perspective.</p><p></p><h2>Outside, Inside</h2><p>A gentle text and bold cut-paper artwork build an evocative mood as they compare and contrast a dramatic thunderstorm outside with a warm and cozy day spent inside.</p><p>Crimi's first book is a story of contrasts: as Molly awakens in the morning and stretches in her flannel robe, "Outside, black clouds sink down to the bottom of the sky." In scenarios alternating between outdoors and indoors, the wind cries, a rabbit scurries, "rain spills from the clouds" and "a slash of lightning scratches the sky" while a grandfather's clock ticks reassuringly, "maple syrup slips down a pancake mountain," Molly's cat naps beside the fireplace and the girl "twirls on her tiptoes." When the sun finally "pushes through a crack in the clouds," Molly opens the door "and lets the outside in!" Crimi's inventive use of language adds lyricism and sparkle to her simple tale, while a striking, airy typeface and stylized cut-paper illustrations provide unusual visual exuberance. Calendar artist Riley's palette nicely complements the tale's theme: the deep blues and greens used to depict the natural world effectively counterbalance the warm hues of Molly's vermilion robe, pink dress and other items found in her snug home. Ages 3-7. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreSchool-Grade 1?Molly spends a rainy morning in a cozy house, playing, eating, and baking, while, outside, animals rush for cover from the storm. When the sun finally comes out, the child opens the door to "let the outside in," and the animals peek out from their hiding places. The text is brief but warm, with descriptions like "pancake mountains" and phrases like "thunder stomps over the hills." The large, vibrant cut-paper illustrations are detailed and full of action, light, and shadows. A comforting story that's sure to appeal to anyone who likes curling up on a rainy day.?Christine A.

Translated from the original Persian.</p><p>Gazzali's own abridgement, in Persian, of his masterwork &#x2018;The Revival of Religious Sciences&#x2019;. This excellent English version is designed for the ordinary reader.One of the great works of mystical religious literature, the Kimiya-i-Sa&#39;adaat strove to bring man closer to understanding God by helping him understand himself. These excerpts from that work, by a strikingly original thinker on Islam who lived and wrote in the 11th century, were first published in 1910, and serve as a potent reminder of how powerful an influence Al-Ghazzali had upon religious philosophers of the Middle Ages, both Christian and Islamic. With its wise and warmly humanistic outlook, this little book may well foster a new measure of understanding in the current philosophical battle between the religious traditions of East and West.</p><h2>Red or Dead: A Novel</h2><p><b>A <i>New York Times </i>Editors' Choice <br><br><i>"</i>[T]he stuff of great literature." &#x2014;<i>The New York Times </i>|&nbsp;"<i>Red or Dead</i> is a winner." &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i><br></b><br>The place where the swinging sixties started&nbsp;&#x2013; Liverpool, England, birthplace of the Beatles&nbsp;&#x2013; wasn&#x2019;t so swinging.

He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and in 1951, won the National Book Award for his biography of Herman Melville<i>.</i> As a scholar and writer, Arvin focused on the secret, psychological drives of such American masters as Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne, and identified the witch-hunt mentality that lies deep in the American psyche. <br><br>Born and raised in the constrained society of Protestant Indiana, Arvin was a social radical and an unproclaimed homosexual. He came through the Red Scare relatively unscathed, but when the national antismut campaign followed, his apartment in Northampton, Massachusetts, where he was a distinguished professor at Smith College, was searched and relatively mild homoerotic materials were confiscated. He was arrested for possession of pornography, accused in the press of being a leader of a "smut ring," and forced to choose between friendship and survival. After naming several men, he despaired at his own guilt and confusion, and banished himself to the state mental institution overlooking the Smith campus. From there public shame and the fear of his associates began to unravel his connections with the esteemed institutions that had been the cornerstones of his life.<br><br>In <b>The Scarlet Professor</b><i>, </i>Barry Werth probes into the virulence with which even the most marginal "sins" are pursued in the fever of America's recurring puritanical crusades. His insights into the tangle of political and moralistic fanaticism underlying America's social landscape provide a forthright and compelling perspective on the dangers of a society where the possibility of a "private life" no longer exists.<br><br>But <b>The Scarlet Professor </b>is not just a political parable. It also a story of redemption. <br><br></p><p>"Barry Werth has brought to vivid life a crucial episode in the history of American repression that is little known. The 'Smith College Homosexual Scandal of 1960,' centrally involving the famed literary critic Newton Arvin, has never before been researched and reported in such fascinating, horrifying detail. Barry Werth has a marvelous narrative gift and he tells his tale with spellbinding skill."-- Martin Duberman<br>Barry Werth brought the story of Newton Arvin and the "Smith College Homosexual Scandal of 1960" to national attention for the first time in almost forty years in <i>The New Yorker. </i>Werth is the author of <b>The Billion-Dollar Molecule </b>and <b>Damages</b>.

Discovering that she has a young grandson, the dowager decides to change her will to leave the bulk of her fortune to the young boy&#x2014;an alteration that stuns the rest of her family. But a scrooge of a determined heir makes sure she never signs the new document. When she is found dead, it's up to that irrepressible spirit Bailey Ruth, on assignment from Wiggins and Heaven's Department of Good Intentions, to protect a little boy, foil a murderer, and save Christmas.</p><p>There's only one teeny hitch: how can Bailey Ruth figure out which family member was desperate enough to kill when everyone has a motive?</p><p>An accomplished master of mystery, Carolyn Hart is the author of twenty previous Death on Demand novels.

In the darkly satiric, often mordantly hilarious sketches that make up <em>Little Tales of Misogyny</em>, Highsmith upsets our conventional notions of female character, revealing the devastating power of these once familiar creatures&#x2015;"The Dancer," "The Female Novelist," "The Prude"&#x2015;who destroy both themselves and the men around them. This work attests to Highsmith's reputation as "the poet of apprehension" (Graham Greene).</p></p><p>Patricia Highsmith (1921&#x2013;1995) was the author of more than twenty novels, including Strangers on a Train, The Price of Salt,&nbsp;The Blunderer and The Talented Mr. Ripley, as well as numerous short stories.The 17 tales in Highsmith's new collection are a far cry from Strangers on a Train and her other unforgettable thrillers. These stories, although written with exemplary style, make the flesh crawl but not pleasurably, as reliable suspense fare does. Each focuses on a female doing in a male or, more often, herself. "The Breeder" Elaine persists in giving birth until her husband Douglas goes irrevocably mad, trying to support 17 children. "The Victim" is Cathy, fond of claiming she's been raped repeatedly in her nubile adolescence. During her career as an airline hostess, Cathy's sexuality pays better in rich gifts than in sympathetic attention. But greed and vanity spell the lush girl's doom. From the book's overall tone, readers could infer that its origin was bitter contempt for humans of either gender. The entries fail as real satire, which is always amusing, regardless of its stings. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide Norway</h2><p><p><b><i>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Norway</i></b> will lead you straight to the best attractions this breathtaking country has to offer.</p><p>Explore Norway region by region, from the enchanting Northern Lights and beautiful fjords to the vibrant Oslo nightlife.

To this day, Australia Under Attack remains the most reliable and accurate account of the Darwin bombings. Darwin was bombed in broad daylight by members of the Japanese Carrier Task Force, which had been engaged at Pearl Harbour two months earlier. Not a single operational R.A.A.F fighter aircraft was available to meet this attack, imminent and inevitable though it was. At the time of the raid, Douglas Lockwood was a correspondent for the Melbourne Herald in Darwin. In the years that followed, he travelled the world interviewing survivors of and participants in the attack to produce the first complete reconstruction of that tragic day.</p><p></p><h2>Tuareg Jewelry: Traditional Patterns and Symbols</h2><p>This picture book offers over 100 photographs of exquisite African art and jewelry (Berber and Tuareg) and explores the story of the legendary Tuaregs of the Sahara desert and their silver jewelry. The book gives a solid background to the origins of this nomadic group of people, and investigates their art forms from prehistoric rock art to modern designs. It was written in collaboration with Berber and Tuareg artists and art experts of Morocco and Niger.</p><p><i>"For you, it may look like a small unimportant detail, like your thumbnail. But for me, it is the whole vast world. Look at this jewel... here is the ant, here is the hyena, the jackal, the hoof of a horse, that of a gazelle, the sun, the moon, the stars, the good eye... this triangle, this is woman, and here are the eyebrows of the Malignant One, there, laughter... it is all of our lives in one piece of silver." </i><br><br> <p><b>(Translated from the French by Helene E. Hagan, from original Tuareg words of an artisan cited by J. Gabus, 1971) </b><br><br> </p><p>An extensive study of the symbolism of Tuareg jewelry has not yet been undertaken to date. It is this simple realization that brought the authors together in a decision to collect information on the topic, from past scholarly journals and books, contemporary articles and web sites, but also from Tuareg informants whose expert knowledge was sought. Though this book is small and does not aspire to be all encompassing, it is the first work totally dedicated to the presentation of the elaborate silver jewelry of Tuareg men and women of Northern Niger in the English language, and the only one we know that is solely dedicated to providing information concerning the function, meanings, and symbols of that jewelry. <br><br> </p><p>The book introduces the reader to the culture of the Tuaregs, a remarkable group of African nomads of the Sahara Desert, which has fascinated the Europeans who came into contact with them in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In the last decade or so, as the Tuareg societies of Niger and Mali underwent major change, a number of American researchers began to document some of their ways. Research and publications in the English language are, however, lagging far behind those in the French language. Fortunately, the primary author of this book, Helene Hagan, was originally educated in the French language, and as an Amazigh (Berber) herself, is very familiar with North African scholarship in the Amazigh culture. Thus, as a bilingual anthropologist of Berber ancestry, born and raised in Morocco, and an activist for Amazigh cultural, linguistic and human rights, she benefits from a fourfold source of valuable information: French scholarship, American contemporary accounts, the latest Amazigh research emanating out of North Africa, and Northern Niger Tuareg informants she knows. This unique set of circumstances gives the book an extra dimension of depth and insight. <br><br> </p><p>The book recounts the myth of origin of the Kel Tamasheq of Niger, and looks at the continuity and development of symbols from archaic inscriptions and rock art of the Sahara to present-day engravings on silver jewelry and the Tifinagh alphabet. The second chapter is entirely devoted to retracing this development and showing the correspondence between Tifinagh characters of the Amazigh alphabet and the elegant, clear lines of geometric designs, which characterize the silver jewelry of the Tuareg people. The two are deeply connected. Modern Tifinagh Calligraphic Art is also featured in this chapter. <br><br> </p><p>The next chapter delves into the mystery of the famous Cross of Agadez and the various hypotheses that have been offered as to its meaning. It depicts the artisanal mode of production, and the functions the crosses hold for Tuareg people themselves. Nowadays, the production of crosses for the western world diminishes the role this cross, Tenghelet tan Agadez, had as a clan identifier. It has become, like other less well known pieces of Tuareg jewelry, a simple ornament or necklace devoid of any particular significance, and the markings on those crosses are losing some of their intentions of yore. <br><br> </p><p>The book reviews specific masculine jewelry and feminine adornment in the next two chapters, and looks at the role various pieces of silver jewelry play in the relations between generations and rites of passage, between men and women, courtship customs and marriage, and more generally n terms of wealth, status, and rank. <br><br> </p><p>Concluding remarks have to underline the fact that motifs belong to a body of representations or symbolic system which is not always known to the users themselves, and even sometimes escapes the knowledge of the artisans who perpetuate the symbolic memory of the group in their repertoire of designs. Traditional knowledge of original meanings and their relation to a world of nomadic lore is diminishing with each generation living under sedentary conditions. Once essential for survival, such knowledge has become the privilege of a few initiates while remaining in the hands of the gifted Tuareg metal workers and jewelers. <br><br> </p><p><i>This book is also available in hardcover format (ISBN 978-1-4257-1537-3) through the publisher. </i></p>Tuareg Jewelry:Traditional Patterns and Symbols Paperback <ul><li><b>ASIN:</b> 1425704530 </li><li><b>ISBN-13:</b> 978-1425704537</li><li><b>Average Review:</b> (5 reviews) </li><li><b>Current Sales Rank:</b> #1,208,609 in Books </li></ul> View on Amazon.com</p><h2>The Octonauts and the Giant Squid.</h2><p>The Octonauts follows a team of adventure heroes who dive right into action whenever there is trouble under the sea.

Madeline, his girlfriend of the past two weeks, was coming over after her shift in a beachfront restaurant and was expecting him to grill some tuna while she whipped up a salad. They would drink cold <i>cerveza</i> and eat on the open patio with the glass doors all the way open, with a fresh ocean breeze coming in while music spilled into the night. They might take a midnight dip, and he would be dazzled by her body in that red bikini with her blond hair reflecting the moonlight. After that, a strategic retreat to the big bedroom to make love while boarders, bladers, dog walkers, tourists, and other lovers strolled the boardwalk out front, unable to see them. <br>No, he decided as he rubbed the freshly painted railing. He didn&#x2019;t have time for that one last swim, and he and Maddy would have to part in the morning, but it had been a hell of a leave. The United States Marine Corps wanted its top sniper back on duty. <br>His telephone rang, as if it had been waiting for just the right moment to ruin the idyllic mood. A glance at the screen showed Lieutenant Colonel Sybelle Summers was calling from Washington. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;Are you out of the lazy vacation mode yet?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Did I ever tell you that you have a sultry voice?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I am your superior officer, Gunnery Sergeant Swanson.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But we slept together once, Sybelle,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Remember? A rainy night in France?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been to France. You must be thinking of your current chippie, what&#x2019;s her name? Michelin, like the tires?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Her name is Madeline, and your memory is slipping. I thought you and I had a deep and special relationship.&#x201d; <br>There was a slight, pleasant change in her tone. &#x201c;Some people just are not that memorable.&#x201d; They both laughed. <br>&#x201c;Sybelle, why are you bothering me on my final evening of leave? Gimme a break, girl. The sun is just about down, I&#x2019;m drinking beer, watching the beach, getting ready to grill a dead fish, Maddy is coming over, and the California weather is perfect. Washington, where you are sitting, is clogged with snow, according to the Weather Channel. I don&#x2019;t want to come back.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Quit whining, Kyle. You built that big house and now you start acting all rich instead of like the raggedy-ass jarhead you are. Maddy, is it? Maddy? Is she out of high school yet?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s a suggestion; why don&#x2019;t you come out here instead? No snow.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Miss Maddy Michelin would be upset if I did that. Let&#x2019;s get to business. You are wanted back here right away.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there tomorrow afternoon anyway, Sybelle, and I can&#x2019;t get back any faster than that.&#x201d; He tilted back the longneck bottle of Corona beer, which was getting warm. The sky had deepened into a band of solid orange that was being chased by the heavy purple night coming from the east, and the sun was moving so fast that it seemed to be falling. <br>&#x201c;Change of plans. A plane will be waiting by the time you get out to John Wayne. I&#x2019;ll meet the flight here, then we go directly to a meeting. Take this thing off speakerphone.&#x201d; <br>He closed the speaker and picked up the receiver. &#x201c;OK. I&#x2019;m listening. This line is not secure.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Really? I had no idea. Does Maddy know that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Can you get to the point?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Some of your father&#x2019;s friends have contacted the boss, and they want us to talk to a guy lives out on the Maryland shore. We&#x2019;ll drive out from Andrews.&#x201d; <br>That was a jolt. It was her way of advising him that Sir Geoffrey Cornwell in Great Britain apparently had pulled the original string to start this ball rolling, and that was Kyle&#x2019;s real other life. The man had been a colonel in the British Special Air Service Regiment before a broken leg forced him into retirement. Refusing to be shelved, he had set out to design technical applications and new weaponry for the military, and was on the cutting edge when the War on Terror dollars started to flow like cheap wine. Eventually, he persuaded the Pentagon to lend him a sniper for technical assistance on a unique project to develop a new kind of long-range rifle, the Excalibur. They had sent Kyle Swanson over to England, and before long, the project was successful, and Jeff and his extraordinary wife, Lady Patricia, who were childless, had found a new friend in Kyle Swanson, an American orphan. <br>Over the years, through some very good times and some very bad and dangerous times, they unconsciously knitted together as a family. Sir Jeff branched into other fields and had a golden touch for business, and although Kyle remained a Marine, he was brought into the business, too, for the Pentagon liked having its own liaison man in the thriving Cornwell pipeline. It had been a special day for Kyle when the Cornwells adopted him as their son. <br>So if Sir Jeff, who was always helping out clandestine operations for the United States and Great Britain, was behind this thing&#x2014;Kyle still didn&#x2019;t know what it was&#x2014;then Swanson would consider it important and worthwhile. The problem had probably gone from Jeff to his friends within the British intelligence service and perhaps even into the prime minister&#x2019;s office before leaping over the pond to the White House. That was enough for Swanson, but a last night with Maddy would have been nice. <br>Kyle paused. &#x201c;So General Middleton himself is ordering me back?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not that boss, Swanson. The <i>big</i> boss. Anyway, Task Force Trident is now involved.&#x201d; <br>That more than aroused his curiosity, but he couldn&#x2019;t swallow it whole. &#x201c;You want me to give up my final night, fly coast-to-coast, get off the plane a few hours before I would get there anyway, and go straight to work in Maryland? That urgent?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Damned straight, Gunny. Consider yourself back on the government dime.&#x201d; She ended the call. <br>&#x201c;Aw, man.&#x201d; Kyle folded his phone and returned it to his pocket. The rim of the sun was almost totally gone, sinking into the Pacific Ocean. It was the moment he always watched for but usually missed, because it happened so quickly. Then there it was, for only a heartbeat, a brilliant sparkle of emerald as the final rim of the sun disappeared. Maybe it was an omen, he thought, an official ending to his two weeks of peace and quiet. Now it was back to being the triggerman for Trident. <br>Reluctantly, he hit the speed dial number to give Madeline the bad news of the broken date. He had to leave right away, he tried to explain, and no, he couldn&#x2019;t say where, and no again, sorry, but he didn&#x2019;t know when he would be back. She was totally unsympathetic and went from angry to cold as fast as the green flash had blinked out. &#x201c;Look, Maddy, I&#x2019;ve built this damned house right on the beach. You think I&#x2019;m going to let it stand empty? Of course I&#x2019;ll be back. And I&#x2019;ll call you the minute I arrive; even before I arrive, I promise.&#x201d; She said something extraordinarily vulgar and hung up on him. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>TWO HOURS LATER, HE was the only passenger aboard a small executive jet that was hauling him from John Wayne Airport outside of Newport Beach, heading to Andrews Air Force Base, just over the Maryland line outside of Washington, D.C. Swanson was in the wide, soft seat and had already finished reading the <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> magazines that were in the seatback. It was a government plane, so there was no flight attendant, but he could fix a drink on his own in the galley, and somewhere over Missouri he would probably test the shrink-wrapped turkey and cheese sandwich. <br>Both magazines had covers showing the mobs demonstrating in the cities of Egypt, and their lead articles were about the latest treacherous political storm that was roiling that ancient country. The situation was deteriorating, just as it had been when he began his leave thirteen days earlier, just as it had been doing for years, if not centuries. <br>He tossed the magazines onto the empty seat across the aisle, settled back, and tried to puzzle together why he was being called back so suddenly. Sybelle&#x2019;s guarded conversation had given him only some very broad parameters for consideration, but they were startling. First of all, she had mentioned Sir Jeff, and also had said it was the big boss calling him home, and emphasized &#x201c;big.&#x201d; His actual commander in Task Force Trident was two-star Marine Major General Bradley Middleton, and the general&#x2019;s only boss was whoever happened to be the president of the United States. <br>More than a decade had passed since terrorists had flown fuel-packed civilian airlines into the Twin Towers in New York, the Pentagon in Washington, and the Pennsylvania dirt. In response, the entire U.S. government had reshaped itself both at home and abroad to make sure such attacks never happened again, and that gave birth to the behemoth Homeland Security Department. Even that wasn&#x2019;t enough, because the inevitable bureaucratic friction soon appeared along the seams of the various departments. Numerous plots had been foiled since 9/11, involving crude devices like explosive shoes and underwear, which proved the system worked as long as people remained alert and paranoid enough to maintain their vigilance. <br>There were always going to be maniacs out there who would try to kill Americans, but airplane hijackers had lost their advantage. The nature of air travel had changed dramatically: Now there were tedious searches by TSA workers before boarding, flight attendants would willingly die rather than open the cockpit door, and every passenger on the plane, from a semipro athlete to a college girl, was ready to jump on a hijacker like a pack of crazed dogs. The willingness of a terrorist to give up his life to achieve his goal was of no use when his targets were equally as willing to die to stop him. <br>The military had also finally changed to accept the talents of Special Forces; elite operations like the Army&#x2019;s Delta Force and the Navy SEALs, and the futuristic technology of remote-controlled drones, had changed the landscape of the battlefield. The Pentagon had met the challenge of terrorism head-on, as had the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and the rest of the alphabet agencies. <br>Nevertheless, there were still holes in the protection net, for publicity, budgets, congressional oversight, and the huge numbers of people supporting and carrying out any operation always tended to multiply over time. The heroes had become <i>known</i>. It had been a short step from that inevitability to the creation of Task Force Trident by people who still cared fervently about secrecy. <br>Trident was invisible by military standards, with a total roster of only five people, including General Middleton, who ran the show. The offices were in a hard-to-find area of the Pentagon, and the budget came out of Homeland Security via the Department of Agriculture. The team was far outside any chain of command other than Middleton&#x2019;s reach to the president. <br>Sybelle Summers was the ops officer, and Master Gunnery Sergeant O. O. Dawkins handled the administrative end, working the inner paths of Pentagon power. Double-Oh could borrow anything in the arsenal, from individual troops to stealth bombers for a Trident mission. The team&#x2019;s only non-Marine was a squid, Commander Benton Freedman of the Navy, a quirky geek whose proprietary electronic net could kick the combined computer butts of Google and Facebook without breaking a sweat. They called him &#x201c;the Lizard,&#x201d; a corruption of his college nickname of &#x201c;Wizard.&#x201d; Swanson handled the wet work. Few people even knew about Trident, but the president always knew where they were, in case they were needed. Like now. <br>He left his seat, went to the head with his Dopp kit, and studied his reflection as he shaved. Swanson was not a big man, standing five feet nine inches, and weighed exactly 176 pounds, with sandy brown hair. Only yesterday, he had been a beach bum wearing baggy board shorts, and now he was back in his Trident uniform of jeans and a dark blue sweatshirt. His Marine dress blues, on a hanger in Washington, carried the three gold stripes and two rockers on the sleeves to denote his USMC rank of gunnery sergeant, with rows of ribbons and awards, including the Congressional Medal of Honor. He loved the uniform and the Corps, which had been his home during long years of training, fieldwork, and assignments around the world and had taught him the trade of the sniper. In doing so, it had honed him into a fierce weapon. <br>He seldom wore the blues these days; he worked in places where he dressed the part he was playing. Jeans and sweatshirts today, maybe a business suit tomorrow, with authentic credentials to match the character. <br>Swanson cleaned his face of leftover lather, replaced the razor, then picked up the alleged sandwich and a can of tomato juice on his way back to his seat. The sandwich was tasteless. He took a few deep breaths, and his mind continued the shift back into the counterintelligence mode. It was like time travel, bridging the freedom he had enjoyed during the past few weeks back into the complex and deadly world of Trident, where only the mission existed. <br>He went to sleep to the hum of the dual engines, leapfrogging in time as the plane moved eastward. The four-hour flight would arrive in Maryland seven hours after he left California. Three hours he wouldn&#x2019;t get to live. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>THE DESCENT TO LAND at Andrews was swift. The plane circled quickly and dropped into the approach path of the most exclusive airport in America, the one that <i>Air Force One,</i> the president&#x2019;s official plane, called home. It was too dark for Kyle to see the trees when the little jet&#x2019;s tires squealed as they caught the runway. The front tilted down until the forward wheels made contact, the reverse thrusters screamed, and the brakes clamped hard to slow the bird. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re here, Gunny,&#x201d; said the copilot as he stepped out of the cabin. &#x201c;The flight OK for you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Anytime the landings come out even with the takeoffs is good by me,&#x201d; Kyle replied with a grin. <br>&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t it the truth.&#x201d; The pilot popped open the small hatch and dropped the stairs. &#x201c;Snowing out there. Watch your step going down, it&#x2019;ll be slickery.&#x201d; <br>Sybelle Summers was waiting on the tarmac nearby beside an old Ford Crown Vic with a single blue light blinking brightly atop its roof. She was as tall as Kyle, with a classic face that never carried much makeup, and snowflakes were catching on the black hair cut to collar length. She wore leg-hugging stretch twill black pants and soft boots, a white sweater of Irish wool, a gray scarf hung loosely around her neck, a rock of a Rolex, and a lot of attitude. The only woman ever to pass the Marine Recon course, she had become a special ops and counterterrorism expert and was on a fast track to someday become a general, if she lived that long. There was nobody Kyle would rather have at his side if the going got rough. <br>Tonight, she had her game face on. A worn black leather gun belt was buckled around her waist, and a big gold badge flashed on her right hip, just in front of the holstered Glock 19. <br>&#x201c;Working undercover, Lieutenant Colonel Summers?&#x201d; he asked. <br>She thrust a padded nylon briefcase at him. It was zipped closed. &#x201c;Homeland Security creds for you tonight and your .45 Colt ACP, loaded and racked with one in the chamber. Grab your gear and get in the car.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; he asked. <br>&#x201c;This guy we were meeting tonight? He&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d; <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Jack Coughlin with Donald A.

In resurrecting the largely forgotten story of McGovern's remarkable presidential bid, Bruce Miroff reveals how his crushing defeat produced an identity crisis for liberals torn between their convictions and the political calculations required to win elections-a dilemma for Democrats that has never gone away.<br><br>Miroff follows the campaign from its surprising rise to its catastrophic fall to remind us how a dark-horse candidate captured the nomination-and then disastrously chose a running mate with a hidden past. Drawing on interviews with dozens of participants&#x2014;including McGovern himself&#x2014;who share a wealth of anecdotes and insights, Miroff traces the insurgency to the political struggles of the sixties, explores McGovern's ideology, and assesses the Republican attack politics that linked McGovern to "acid, amnesty, and abortion." <br><br>Miroff shows how the transformative election of 1972 signaled a major shift in the Democratic base&#x2014;from urban blue-collar New Dealers to suburban, issue-oriented activists (feminists and gay rights advocates among them)&#x2014;as the party shed its Cold War past and embraced an antiwar orientation. He also illuminates how the McGovern campaign mastered the new game of presidential primaries and explores the formative experiences of a generation of talented young political actors, including campaign manager Gary Hart, political newcomer Bill Clinton, and future party strategists Bob Shrum and John Podesta. In excavating the 1972 landslide, he follows the subsequent careers of the young McGovernites and describes the loss's effects on later Democratic presidential campaigns.<br><br>By tracing the transformation of American liberalism and sixties idealism from their political crash in 1972 to the muddled centrism of the twenty-first century, <i>The Liberals' Moment</i> shows what the McGovern insurgency has to teach us today&#x2014;and identifies what Democrats must do in order to reassume the mantle of progressive change.</p><p>&#34;Wise and informative.&#34;"A deeply perceptive and stunningly fresh narrative of a major turning point in U.S. political history.

He is a professor of linguistics, bewitched by language, deluded about his ability to win the hearts of women with his erudition and physical appeal. He is Thomas H. Chippering, a.k.a. Tomcat, a masterly addition to the pantheon of unforgettable characters in American fiction.<br><br>And in his private dictionary of love, three entries stand out.<br><br><b>Tampa.</b> Just the word makes Tom Chippering's blood curdle. That's where his ex-wife, the faithless Lorna Sue, now lives with a suntanned tycoon whose name Chippering refuses to utter.<br><br><b>Revenge.</b> If Chippering can't get Lorna Sue back, at least he can wreak havoc with her new marriage. (How about some strategically placed lingerie in the tycoon's "ostentatiously upscale Mercedes"?) He also has plans for Lorna Sue's brother, Herbie, with whom she has always had an unnaturally close relationship.<br><br><b>Love.</b> His ex-wife may have disapproved, but is Chippering's fondness for women--especially the nubile coeds who attend his classes--really so wrong? And now love finds a new form: Mrs. Robert Kooshof, the attractive, demanding, and, of course, already married woman who may at last satisfy Chippering's longing for intimacy.<br><br>Tim O'Brien--acclaimed for his fiction about the Vietnam War--has now taken on the battle between the sexes with astonishing results. By turns hilarious, outrageous, romantic, and deeply moving, <i>Tomcat in Love</i> gives us a blundering, modern-day Don Juan who embodies the desires and bewilderments of men everywhere.</p><p>To date, Tim O'Brien's novels have all shared common traits: his heroes hail from the Midwest, usually Minnesota; Vietnam figures prominently; and the stories he tells, though invested with mordant wit, are usually pretty grim. So an O'Brien fan coming to <i>Tomcat in Love</i> on the heels of his earlier novels can be forgiven for occasionally checking the name on the cover (and the photo on the dust jacket) just to be <i>sure</i> this is, indeed, the same Tim O'Brien who wrote <i>Going After Cacciato</i>, <i>The Things They Carried</i>, <i>If I Die in a Combat Zone</i>, and <i>In the Lake of the Woods</i>.<p> In <i>Tomcat in Love</i> O'Brien introduces us to a very different hero: "In summary, then, my circumstances were these. Something over forty-nine years of age. Recently divorced. Pursued. Prone to late-night weeping. Betrayed not once but threefold: by the girl of my dreams, by her Pilate of a brother, and by a Tampa real-estate tycoon whose name I have vowed never again to utter." Thomas H. Chippering, professor of linguistics, war hero, and sex magnet--in his own mind, at least, has recently lost his childhood sweetheart and wife of 20 years to another man, the Tampa magnate, and Lorna Sue's desertion has clearly unhinged him. He has taken to flying down to Tampa from Minnesota on weekends to spy on his ex-wife and plot revenge against her, the tycoon, and Lorna Sue's brother, Herbie, whom he blames for destroying his marriage. </p><p> Thomas, Lorna Sue, and Herbie go back a long way together, bound equally by ties of love, guilt, and suspicion. Dating from the afternoon young Herbie nailed an even younger Lorna Sue's hand to a makeshift cross, Thomas has occupied a kind of emotional no man's land between the two: "In my bleakest moods, when black gets blackest, I think of it as a high perversion: Herbie coveted his own sister. Which is a fact. The stone truth. He was in love with her. More generously, I will sometimes concede that it was not sexual love, or not entirely, and that Herbie was driven by the obsessions of a penitent, a torturer turned savior. Partly, too, I am quite certain that Herbie secretly associated me with his own guilt. I was present at the beginning. My backyard, my plywood, my green paint." </p><p> Chippering takes his revenge to hilarious lengths, starting with a purple leather bra and panties stuffed beneath the seat of the tycoon's car and escalating from there. But even as he attempts to wreak havoc in his ex-wife's life, he succeeds in laying ruin to his own. His self-proclaimed irresistibility to women gets him in hot water with both his female students and his administration; his obsession with Lorna Sue threatens his budding romance with Mrs. Robert Kooshof, a woman who loves him as his wife never did--and, oh yes, there's that little matter of the squad of Green Berets he crossed many years before in Vietnam who may or may not be hunting him down. </p><p> Once you get over the shock of this new, funny Tim O'Brien, traces of the writer you thought you knew begin to surface. Chippering might be a pompous, overbearing windbag, but you can't trust him any more than you did any of O'Brien's other earthier, equally unreliable narrators. In one breath, he tells us, "I must in good conscience point out that women find me attractive beyond words. And who on earth could blame them?" In the next he describes himself as resembling "a clean-shaven version of our sixteenth president." Half the fun of reading <i>Tomcat in Love</i> is trying to sort out just how much of what Thomas H. Chippering tells us is true. Stellar writing, a brilliant cast of characters, and a sly, surprising story that breaks your heart one minute and tickles your funny bone the next all make Tim O'Brien's first foray into the comic novel a resounding success. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"<i>Tomcat in Love</i> is a wonderful novel, laugh-out-loud funny, one of the best books I've come across in years.

There is something obscure for every taste, from By Design , a "sunny sex comedy" starring Patty Duke Astin as half of a lesbian couple, to Lodz Ghetto , an "evocative and horrifying" Holocaust documentary--although most video stores are unlikely to carry such fare. But many of the films, such as A Cry in the Dark , starring Meryl Streep, and Rob Reiner's highly praised satire This Is Spinal Tap , hardly seem to fit the book's subtitle, The Best Films You've Never Seen . The guide is marred by pretentiousness, as when Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader laboriously compares Martin Scorsese's After Hours with the director's earlier film Raging Bull , with less-than-compelling insights: "Where Raging Bull covered a period of some 20 years . . . the new film takes place in the small hours of a single night." The incisive reviews of critics like Terrence Rafferty and Pauline Kael are a refreshing contrast.

The 40 members of the society, who write for general-interest magazines and newspapers, admirably clean out their clip files around this theme: a few of the reviews were unpublished, but most appeared between 1970 and 1990; none is original for this work.

The Sigillum Dei Aemeth</h2><p>Softcover. The 2nd edition of this title. Octavo. xx + 156pp. Color frontispiece and one colour plate, b&amp;w illustrations and tables, appendixes, index. "The Magic Seal of John Dee" comprises a detailed examination of the history and structure of the Sigillum Dei �meth of the Elizabethan scholar and magician, Dr. John Dee, as well as a study of its use in the practice of ritual magic. The book not only elaborates on the patterns used in constructing the Sigillum Dei, but also brings it out of the limited confines of the Enochian temple and shows it to be a magical system in its own right. The recognition of the patterns established in the construction of the Sigillum Dei allows us to view the seal in a new light, not as a static object whose design was immutably fixed in the study of a Renaissance magician, but as a dynamic instrument that can be reconstituted in the light of modern interpretation. The author further demonstrates that beneath its fa�ade lies a powerful system of evocation that can be used for the very same method of angelic communication as that used by Dee and Kelley in its reception. He explains the nature and method of its use in evocation and in so doing reveals the Sigillum Dei as a powerful system of planetary magick. The appendices also include a new transcription and translation of Dee's "Liber Mysteriorum Secundus", the source-work that details the reception of the Sigillum Dei, and a translation of the section of the famous grimoire, "The Sworn Book of Honorius", that defines the earliest known precursor of the Sigillum Dei. The author, Colin D. Campbell, is a long-time student and teacher of the Thelemic, Kabbalistic, and Enochian magical systems. In addition to "The Magic Seal of John Dee" he has also authored "Of the Arte Goetia", compiled and edited "A Concordance to the Holy Books of Thelema", and edited the Frederick Hockley edition of "A Book of the Offices of Spirits."</p><p></p><h2>Calico &amp; Chintz: Antique Quilts from the Collection of Patricia S.

To save her people, Kamoj has contracted to marry Jax Ironbridge, the moody, unpredictable ruler of a prosperous land. Then a mysterious stranger from another world proposes a marriage that neither honor nor law will allow Kamoj to refuse.<p> <i>The Quantum Rose</i> is the sixth novel in the acclaimed Saga of the Skolian Empire, following the novels <i>Primary Inversion</i>, <i>Catch the Lightning</i>, <i>The Last Hawk</i>, <i>The Radiant Seas</i>, and <i>Ascendant Sun</i>. This intelligent, entertaining series combines space opera, hard SF, future history, military SF, and romance in a rare and potent blend. <i>The Quantum Rose</i> is an interplanetary adventure, but the space-opera and hard-SF elements are less prominent, as the plot focuses on a compelling and complicated love triangle, the clash of very different cultures, and an approach to war that SF has almost never considered.</p><p> A Nebula Award finalist, Catherine Asaro has won the <i>Analog</i> Readers' Poll, the Sapphire Award, and the Homer Award.

But now a diabolical killer is challenging Rhyme to a terrifying and ingenious duel of wits. With police detective Amelia Sachs by his side, Rhyme must follow a labyrinth of clues that reaches back to a dark chapter in New York City&#x2019;s past&#x2014;and reach further into the darkness of the mind of a madman who won&#x2019;t stop until he has stripped life down to the bone.</p><p>The hero of Jeffery Deaver's thriller <i>The Bone Collector</i> is Lincoln Rhyme, a forensic scientist known to his peers as "the world's foremost criminalist." Rhyme will need all his reason--and his considerable stock of high-tech tools--about him to solve this latest brain-twister: a serial killer with method to his madness. In tried and true thriller fashion, the killer's crimes are described in lurid detail, as is the astounding technological equipment with which Rhyme examines the evidence--everything from an energy-dispersive x-ray unit to a mass spectrometer. <p> Every fictional detective has his or her gimmick, from Sherlock Holmes's violin to Nero Wolf's orchids, and Rhyme is no exception. He is a quadriplegic who can move nothing but a single finger. Gadget-philes will be in seventh heaven reading about Lincoln Rhyme's tools; other readers might feel the book could do with a few more plausible characters and a little less technology.</p><b>Jeffery Deaver </b>is the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of more than thirty-five novels, including&nbsp;the Lincoln Rhyme series. He has been nominated for seven Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America and is a three-time recipient of the Ellery Queen Readers Award for Best Short Story of the Year.</p><h2>Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre</h2><p>An overview of musical theatre offers information on Britain&#39;s provincial theatres, American stages outside New York, new shows, revivals, and biographical sketches of singers and actors around the world.</p><p>Kurt Ganzl is the world&#39;s leading authority on musical theater. He is the acclaimed author of The British Musical Theater, Ganzl&#39;s Book of the Musical Theater and the Encyclopedia of the Musical Theater. He has written and recorded a 25-part radio series on the history of the musical theater, as well as completing his first book specifically treating the America musical stage, Ganzl&#39;s Book of the Broadway Musical. He now lives in New Zealand.The author of <i>The British Musical Theatre</i> (Oxford, 1987) and <i>G&#x201e;nzl's Book of the Musical Theatre</i> (Schirmer, 1989) shares his passion in this international compendium. Here are approximately 2,700 entries for performers, composers, writers, and shows; some producers, directors, choreographers, and designers are included as well. The scope is the text-based musical (no opera, pantomines, or revues) as performed in Britain, Europe, the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. While the choice of entries is ultimately idiosyncratic, G&#x201e;nzl sought subjects most widely known internationally. This means there are no entries for such well-known American performers as Stubby Kaye and Robert Alda while many obscure nineteenth-century European performers are covered.<p>Entries are generally at least two paragraphs in length and can be as long as three pages (e.g., for Richard Rogers, Franz von Supp{&#x201a;}e) and start with a brief identifier (e.g., "Musical comedy in 2 acts by Harold Atteridge"). For people, basic biographical information is given with lists of the musicals in which they were involved. When available, biographies or autobiographies are listed. Plot summaries and international performance history are given for musicals. Film adaptations are described, and some recordings and books are cited. The 315 black-and-white illustrations include cast shots and covers of playbills and sheet music. The arrangement is alphabetical; cross-references and an index are lacking.</p><p>G&#x201e;nzl's introduction indicates that he collects everything he can find on musicals but also does library and archive research to verify his facts. The writing here is informal and slangy, often in a British vein. For example, the article on Casanova comments "on those allegedly rare occasions when he was not out putting it about."</p><p>Other reference books on musical theater are more narrow in scope (Bordman's <i>American Musical Theater</i>, 2d ed. [<i>RBB</i> Jl 92]; Stanley Green's <i>Encyclopedia of the Musical Theater</i> [Da Capo, 1980]; Swain's <i>The Broadway Musical</i> [Oxford, 1990]) and may suffice in many public libraries. <i>G&#x201e;nzl's Book of the Musical Theatre</i> covers 300 shows from seven countries in much greater detail than this encyclopedia. The coverage in this new set is wide, and articles are readable and informative. Although seemingly adequately researched, it is not written in a scholarly style. An index and/or cross-references would have greatly increased access to the information. This is a must for music collections and is worth considering for academic and large public libraries. <i></i></p></p><h2>American Language Supplement 2</h2><p><p>The DEFINITIVE EDITION OF <i>The American Language</i> was published in 1936.&nbsp; Since then it has been recognized as a classic.&nbsp; It is that rarest of literary accomplishments&#x2014;a book that is authoritative and scientific and is at the same time very diverting reading.&nbsp; But after 1936 HLM continued to gather new materials diligently.&nbsp; In 1945 those which related to the first six chapters of <i>The American Language</i> were published as <i>Supplement I</i>; the present volume contains those new materials which relate to the other chapters.<br><br>The ground thus covered in <i>Supplement II</i> is as follows:<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>American Pronunciation.</i>&nbsp; Its history.&nbsp; Its divergence from English usage.&nbsp; The regional and racial dialects.<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>American Spelling.</i>&nbsp; The influence of Noah Webster upon it.&nbsp; Its characters today.&nbsp; The simplified spelling movement.&nbsp; The treatment of loan words.&nbsp; Punctuation, capitalization, and abbreviation.<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Common Speech.</i>&nbsp; Outlines of its grammar.&nbsp; Its verbs, pronouns, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs.&nbsp; The double negative.&nbsp; Other peculiarities.<br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Proper Names in America.</i>&nbsp; Surnames.&nbsp; Given-names.&nbsp; Place-names.&nbsp; Other names.<br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>American Slang.&nbsp; Its origin and history.&nbsp; </i>The argot of various racial and occupational groups.<br><br>Although the text of <i>Supplement II</i> is related to that of <i>The American Language</i>, it is an independent work that may be read profitably by persons who do not know either <i>The American Language </i>or <i>Supplement I</i>.</p></p><p>Henry Louis Mencken was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on September 12, 1880, and died there during the night of January 28-9, 1956.&nbsp; A son of August and Anne (Abhau) Mencken, he was educated privately and at the Baltimore Polytechnic.&nbsp; He married (August 27, 1930) Sara Powell Haardt, who died on May 31, 1935.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mencken became a reporter for the <i>Baltimore Morning Herald</i> in 1899; its city editor in 1903; and editor of the <i>Evening Herald</i> in 1905.&nbsp; He served on the staff of the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> from 1906 to 1910 and on that of the <i>Evening Sun</i> from 1910 to 1917 and again from 1920 to 1935.&nbsp; But he never ceased to be associated with the <i>Sun</i> papers, and was for many, many years a director for their publishers, The A.S.

He lives in Cedar City, Utah.</p><p>1</p><p>Fitzhugh</p><p>At times, every professor believes that his classroom represents the abnegation of intelligence, if not absolute abiosis. This feeling has been universewide since long before the Tellurian Diaspora. Lughday was no exception, especially not for my fourth-period class, Historical Trends 1001, the introductory course, one of the core requirements for undergraduates.</p><p>I walked through the door into the small amphitheatre classroom and toward the dais. Forty bodies sat waiting in four tiers, arrayed in a semicircle&#x2014;all avoiding my scrutiny. At times such as the one before me, I could only wish that the university did not require all full professors to teach one introductory course every year, at a bare minimum. I&#x2019;d drawn fourth period&#x2014;right after lunch, and that made it even more of a challenge.</p><p>I stationed myself behind the podium, the representation of a practice significantly untransformed in almost ten thousand recorded years of human history&#x2014;and for the last five, savants and pedants had prognosticated the decline of personal and physical-presence classroom instruction. Yet in all instances where such ill-considered experimentation in technologically based pedagogical methodology had been attempted in an effort to replace what had worked, if imperfectly, the outcomes and the ramifications had ranged from social catastrophe to unmitigated disaster, even as my predecessors in pedagogy had predicted such eventualities.</p><p>Technology and implementation had never constituted the difficulty, but rather the genetic and physiological strengths and limitations of human cognitive and learning patterns. From a historical perspective, successful technological applications are those that enhance human capacities, not those that force humans into prestructured technological niches or functions.</p><p>As I cleared my throat and stepped to the podium, the murmurs died away. I glanced down at the shielded screen before picking a name, smiling politely, and speaking. "Scholar Finzel, please identify the single most critical aspect of the events leading to the Sunnite-Covenanter Conflagration of 3237."</p><p>"Ser?" Finzel offered a blank look.</p><p>For the second class of the first semester, blank looks were not exactly infrequent, not for beginning students, especially for those from nonshielded continents or from the occasional off-planet scholar. "I realize neolatry precludes your interest in matters of past history, but since the Conflagration resulted in the devastation of Meath, extensive damage to the Celtic worlds of the Comity, and significant taxation increases for the entire Comity, and since both the Covenanters and the Alliance have continued to rearm and rebuild their fleets, with a continued hostility exemplified most recently by the so-called pacification of the Mazarene systems and the forcible annexation of the Walden Libracracy . . ."</p><p>That not-so-gentle reminder did not remove the expression of incomprehension, but only added one of veiled hostility. I used the screen to check his background. As I&#x2019;d vaguely recalled, he was from Ulster, where he could have netlinked and been provided the answer.</p><p>"Scholar Finzel," I said politely, "Gregory is a shielded continent, and the university is a shielded institution. You are expected to read the texts before class. For some reason, you seem unable to comprehend this basic requirement. I suggest you remedy the situation before the next class." I turned to a student with a modicum of interest in her eyes. "Scholar MacAfee?"</p><p>"According to Robertson Janes, ser, there were two linked causes of the Conflagration. The first was the malfunction of the communications linkages of the Covenanter fleet command, and the second was the widespread perception among the population of the Alliance worlds that the Covenanters intended to spread a nanogenevirus that would transform all herbivores into hogs." A hint of a smile crossed Scholar MacAfee&#x2019;s lips.</p><p>"You&#x2019;re in the general area," I replied, "but I don&#x2019;t believe that Janes said the Covenanter fleet&#x2019;s command communications malfunctioned. Do you recall exactly what he wrote?"</p><p>MacAfee frowned.</p><p>"Anyone else?"</p><p>"Ser?" The tentative voice was that of Ariel Leanore, a dark-haired young woman who looked more like a girl barely into seminary, rather than at university.</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"I think . . . didn&#x2019;t he write something ... it was more like . . . the expectations of instantaneous response resulted in the ill-considered reprisal on Hajj Majora.. . and that reprisal made the Sunnis so angry that they passed the legislation funding the High Caliph&#x2019;s declaration of Jihad. There were rumors about the Spear of Iblis, but those were noncausal. . ." Leanore paused, her voice trailing away.</p><p>"Very good, Scholar Leanore." I stopped and surveyed the faces, seeing that most of them still hadn&#x2019;t grasped the impact of Janes&#x2019;s words. "The expectations of instantaneous response . . . what does that mean?"</p><p>All forty faces were blank with the impermeability of incomprehension. When I had been in the service, I had believed that such an expression was limited to those of less-than-advanced intelligence. The years in academia had convinced me that it appeared upon the visages of all too many individuals in the adolescent and postadoles cent years, regardless of innate intelligence or the lack thereof.</p><p>"What it means ..." I drew out the words. ".. . is that instantaneous communications and control preclude the opportunity for considered thought and reflection. The Covenanter command had the ability to order and carry out an immediate reprisal. They did so. They did not think about the fact that the Covenanter trading combines on Hajj Majora had, within the terms of their culture, acted responsibly against those Covenanters who had manipulated the terms of exchange in a manner that could be most charitably described as fraud." I cleared my throat. There are definite disadvantages to auditory lectures, especially without even sonic boosting, but my discomfort was irrelevant to those who had enacted the shielding compact. "Now that you know that, why did I initially suggest that there was only one critical aspect to these events?"</p><p>"You suggest that both events listed by Janes share a commonality, ser?" That was Scholar Amyla Sucharil, one of three exchange students from the worlds of the Middle Kingdom.</p><p>"Not only the events cited by Janes, but those cited by Yamato and Alharif."</p><p>"Isn&#x2019;t it communications? They all deal with communications, ser," suggested Leanore.</p><p>Young Ariel might have been tentative, but at least she was thinking, unlike most of the others. "Exactly! Both the events cited by Janes were the result of misunderstanding and misapplications of the use and function of communications, if in different societal aspects. If you apply the same tests to the examples of Yamato and Alharif, you&#x2019;ll find a similar pattern." I smiled, not that I wanted to, because it was likely to be a long afternoon. "History illustrates a pattern in communications. In low-tech civilizations, only immediate personal communications can be conveyed with any speed, and those are often without detail. As more detail is required, communications slow. As technology improves, there is always a trade-off between speed and detail, because improving technology results in greater societal and infrastructural complexity, which requires greater detail. Until the development of fullband comm and nanoprocessing, this trade-off existed to a greater or lesser degree. For the past millennium or so, however, the limitation on communications has not been the technology. What has it been?" I surveyed the faces, some beginning to show apprehension as they realized that they did not know the answer, and that I might indeed call upon them.</p><p>"Would it be understanding, ser?" ventured Sucharil.</p><p>"Precisely! Just because you have the information, and even a hundred near-instantaneous analyses, doesn&#x2019;t mean that you truly know what to do with it, particularly when the analyses may be conflicting, depending on the background assumptions and the weight of the evidence. This was particularly true in the case of the Conflagration, because of the cultural imperatives of both the Covenanters and the Alliance. Even today, any analyses dealing with the interaction of those cultures are problematical."</p><p>"Ser? Why does it matter that much?" That was from Emory David. "The Comity has a thousand world members, and the Covenanters have less than two hundred. There can&#x2019;t be more than seventy Alliance worlds."</p><p>"What is the first rule of interstellar warfare?" I replied.</p><p>"No planet can be effectively defended against a determined attack . . . ser . . ." replied Scholar David.</p><p>"And what are the beliefs behind a jihad?"</p><p>Finally, comprehension began to illuminate a few faces.</p><p>"You mean, ser, that they don&#x2019;t care because they&#x2019;ll go to paradise?"</p><p>"Or Heaven, if they&#x2019;re Covenanters doing the Will of the Divine, and seeking to ensure that we do not recover the Morning Star," I replied dryly.</p><p>"But. .. that&#x2019;s a myth without foundation . . ."</p><p>I could not ascertain the source of that incredulous murmur.</p><p>"Not to true believers, it is not. Not even in this so-called enlightened and rational times, and certainly not upon the Worlds of the Covenant. The Morning Star, or the Spear of Iblis, the Hammer of Lucifer, whatever the specific term, is a symbol of forbidden knowledge, knowledge that is considered only the province of Iblis, Satan, or their demon children. If there is one aspect of all true-believer religions that remains constant across time and history, it is that certain aspects of technology or science are forbidden by the deity because use of that knowledge usurps the powers and privileges of the deity. Such theocracies will therefore commit great violence over issues or scientific practices that would appear common to many of you." I inhaled slowly, for a pause. "With regard to this, even if the Comity is more secular in outlook, once the theocracies have used force against our interests, such actions require force in response, or the perception of weakness will cost even more in the long run. We lost the populations of ten worlds. The Covenanters lost thirty and the Alliance nearly forty. It has taken close to ten centuries for them to recover, half that for us, except that a dead world remains that for longer than we or any other humans will be around to recolonize. A hundred worlds scoured . . . would you like it to happen again, on Ulster, or Lyr? Or perhaps Culain or Liaden?" I paused. "Or perhaps the Covenanters are somewhat sensitive to the power of position, in which case, what happens to be the other leading secular polity? The one with whom they share the closest stellar congruencies?"</p><p>"The . . . Middle Kingdom?"</p><p>"Correct. Now . . . my skepticism is almost without limbi, but most recently the First Advocate of the Middle Kingdom died in circumstances resembling assassination&#x2014;right after he had delivered a series of addresses severely critical of the theocratic expansionism of the worlds of the Covenant. What might happen if the Middle Kingdom were reputed to obtain some forbidden knowledge, something resembling the Spear of Iblis? To borrow an ancient metaphor, how long before the sabres began to rattle? Again . . . just over, if you will, information?"</p><p>There was silence in the room, although I could hear someone murmur, "It couldn&#x2019;t happen again ..." I refrained from suggesting all too many people, particularly politicians, had said those words, or some variation, over hundreds of centuries, generally to everyone&#x2019;s regret.</p><p>"Now ... I&#x2019;d like each of you to take a moment to reflect. I would like each of you to come up with an example from history where information and how it was handled was critical in determining the fate of something&#x2014;an army, a fleet, a nation, a world." I held up a hand to forestall the objections. "I know. Once you&#x2019;re away from Gregory, you can netlink and get a reply, ordered by whatever parameters you suggest. The point of this exercise is to develop your judgment so that when you do that in the future, you will have a greater understanding of what that information actually means."</p><p>This time the majority of expressions were those of resignation. I supposed that was an improvement. If they thought what I was requiring was difficult, they hadn&#x2019;t even considered what was going to be required in the later stages of applied manual mathematics. I&#x2019;d learned, years earlier, that if I leaned on the students hard in the opening classes, the classes got easier and more rewarding toward the end. Unfortunately, doing so, and maintaining a cheerful demeanor in the process, was arduous in the first weeks of the semester.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t quite breathe a sigh of relief when fourth period was over and I left the classroom, walking down the ramp to the main level. There were times I could feel my hands tightening, wanting to throttle certain students. The best ones cared for knowledge as a tool, and the worst only sought a degree with marks that would guarantee entry into some multi or another or into the Comity bureaucracy, which was worse, from what I&#x2019;d seen, than that of academia. I could not help but wish, at times, that I were back teaching in the days prior to the Disapora on Old Earth, where everything had been broadband and without the direct face-to-face student contact that reminded me all too often of how little most of them cared for knowledge itself.</p><p>But. . . that time on Old Earth had been before the discovery of the subtle but far-reaching effects of broadcast energies, even at extraordinarily low power, on neonatal and prematuration mental development. The Comity had banned wide-scale public and private broadcast of information and power, and relied on monoptic distribution systems, unlike the more conservative governments, such as the Covenanters and Sunnite Alliance, for whom cost-benefit analyses included individuals with environmentally damaged attention spans. I couldn&#x2019;t help but snort to myself. My students had short enough attention spans without additional technological assistance in shortening them further. The continent of Gregory, as many other continents on Comity worlds, had even more stringent requirements than the baseline regulations in force throughout the entire Comity of Worlds.</p><p>Once back in my office, little more than an overlarge closet three meters on a side, I settled myself behind my console and keyed in the codes to call up my in-comms&#x2014; there were no personal direct-links at the university, or for that matter, anywhere on the continent.</p><p>The first message was from the provost&#x2014;just a message, and no text.</p><p>Congratulations on being nominated for a senior fellowship with the Comity Diplomatic Corps. Your continued diligence in seeking outside validation and recognition of your talents, accomplishments, and credentials has not gone unnoticed . . .</p><p>I just looked at the message. The last thing I wanted was a senior fellowship with the CDC. Years back, my service tours had convinced me of the futility of government service. I certainly had not applied for such a fellowship. Had the provost nominated me? Why? Had I been that much of a thorn in his bureaucratic side? It didn&#x2019;t matter. In the unlikely event I happened to be selected, I&#x2019;d politely refuse. There were more than enough brilliant junior professors who wanted such empty honors and would be happy to accept.</p><p>I moved to the next message.</p><p></p><p>Excerpted from The Eternity Artifact by L.

For Bob Skinner, it's a desperate race to find a relentless terrorist and a mercy killer.</p><p>These hair-trigger thrillers by Quintin Jardine, one of Scotland�s top-selling writers, have been praised for their ingenious plotting and powerful emotional drama. With Edinburgh police chief Robert Skinner at the center of the action, they form a first-class, robustly entertaining series of police procedurals. <p>Also available by Quintin Jardine: <i>Autographs in the Rain</i>, <i>Thursday Legends</i>, <i>Murmuring the Judges</i>,<i>Skinner's Ghosts</i>, <i>Skinner's Rules</i>, <i>Skinner's Festival</i>, <i>Skinner's Trail</i>, <i>Skinner's Round</i>, <i>Skinner's Ordeal</i> and <i>Skinner's Mission</i>. </p>Quintin Jardine was born once upon a time in the West - of Scotland rather than America, but still he grew to manhood as a massive Sergio Leone fan.

These were the days when the team was on the edge of greatness and about to take it all and become the hockey dynasty of the &#39;80s. It&#39;s amazing to look back at 1980-81 and consider that some of the game&#39;s greatest players came together on a young team and quickly blazed their way into the record books and the consciousness of a nation. This is also a book about hockey&#39;s magnificent history, about Morenz, Richard, Howe, Orr, Hull . the men whose rare and indefinable genius on the ice exemplified the speed, grit, and innovation of the game. The Game of Our Lives is unlike any book ever written in the annals of hockey. It weaves together the elements of the game, both past and present, and presents an intelligent and moving account of why hockey means so much to so many.</p><p>Former host of CBC Radio&#x2019;s &#x201c;Morningside,&#x201d; <b>Peter Gzowski</b> was one of Canada&#x2019;s pre-eminent journalists.

Facing heavy competition from similar publications, Franklin took the unusual and controversial approach of injecting witty, unexpected entries between standard tables of tides, planetary motion, weather predictions and other facts. In the debut edition, faithfully reproduced here, he included under the heading Principal Kings of Europe, &#34;&#34;Poor Richard, an American Prince, without subjects, his wife being Viceroy over him, born October 23, 1684, age 49.&#34;&#34; The Almanack went on to become the most popular book of it&#39;s kind in colonial America and was published annually for the next 25 years. This facsimile offers a unique and entertaining look at 18th century American life and humor.Franklin's Autobiography is one of the most famous works in American literature. He started it as a private collection of anecdotes for his son, but soon it was transformed into a work of history, both personal and national, revealing Franklin as the man who, as Herman Melville said, possessed "deep worldly wisdom and polished Italian tact, gleaming under an air of Arcadian unaffectedness. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>The Boombox Project: The Machines, the Music, and the Urban Underground</h2><p>On the heels of the graffiti renaissance comes a vibrant look at an old-school icon that figured prominently in the hip-hop, rock &amp; roll, and punk movements of the 1970s and 80s. <i>The Boombox Project </i>features contemporary fine art portraits of an array of vintage boomboxes, as well as scores of documentary photographs of the people who brought the boombox movement to life back in the day.<p></p><br> &nbsp;<p></p><br> The book is more than just a collection of images, though; it&#x2019;s also an oral history of the early days of hip-hop, featuring memories from Fab&nbsp;5 Freddy, Bob Gruen, Rosie Perez, Kool Moe Dee, LL Cool J, Lisa Lisa, DJ Spooky, and Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys, among others, on the role this once ubiquitous machine played.<br>Part pop cultural history and part &#x201c;gadget porn,&#x201d; this lively and highly stylish volume is one of the cool books of the season.<br><br>Praise for <i>The Boombox Project</i>:<br><br>"Photographer Lyle Owerko tells the whole story with crisp still lifes and an oral history of an era when graffiti and antigentrification ruled."&nbsp;--<i>Playboy</i>, October 2010<br><p></p></p><p>Lyle Owerko is a New York&#x2013;based filmmaker and photographer whose clients have included the Sundance Channel and MTV.

Figure Drawing examines each of these factors separately and then looks at their interrelation within a drawing. Rather than dictating formulas, it points out the universal facts and forces exemplified in dozens of drawings of draped and nude figures, to help the reader understand the total scope and creative potential of the four basic elements. A concise exploration of structural issues establishes structure not only as a volume-builder but as a rich source of visual and expressive invention. The chapters on design and expression explore thoroughly the abstract dynamics of figure drawing; these alert the artist to important aspects of perception which emerge from the subject matter, the artist, and the evolving drawing itself....&#34;</p><p>A comprehensive examination of the ways in which the four basic factors in drawing the figure -- structure, anatomy, design, and expression -- assist and govern each other.Key Benefit: A comprehensive examination of the ways in which the four basic factors in drawing the figure&#x2014;structure, anatomy, design, and expression&#x2014;assist and govern each other.

This important book revises that image, showing that the small but vibrant Dutch city produced fine examples of all the major arts, including luxury goods and sophisticated paintings for the court at The Hague and for patrician collectors in Delft itself. The book traces the history and culture of Delft from the 1200s through the lifetime of the city&#39;s most renowned painter, Johannes Vermeer. The authors discuss at length some ninety major paintings (seventeen by Vermeer), forty drawings, and a choice selection of decorative arts, all of which are reproduced in full colour. Among the paintings are state portraits, history pictures, still lifes, views of palaces and church interiors, illusionistic murals, and refined genre pictures by Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch. The rich works on paper encompass exquisite drawings by Delft artists and sketches of the town by visiting artists. Included in the decorative arts are tapestries, bronze statuary, silver, Delftware, and glass. The volume concludes with an essay that takes the reader on a walk through seventeenth-century Delft. It is accompanied by maps of the city&#39;s neighbourhoods that indicate major monuments and the homes of patrons, art dealers, and painters.

At first, friends and physicians assumed they were victims of "crib death" or an inexplicable genetic flaw.

Without hard evidence, officialdom was agonizingly slow to act, but finally, following a police interrogation, Marybeth made a confession (later retracted) to smothering three children.

The movement, almost exclusively the province of master craftsmen, involved goldsmiths, carpenters, engravers, stone-masons and printers, who playfully engaged with perspective studies of the regular three-dimensional mathematical figures. The various books that they produced were published at a time of enormous political and cultural change and contain astonishing graphics that have now, for the first time, been gathered together in a single volume. Today, these fundamental forms, beautifully conceived over five and a half centuries ago, still retain the capacity to engage our attention and act as a perennial source of artistic inspiration.</p><p></p><h2>Sick Notes</h2><p>The eagerly-awaited second novel from the author of the highly praised <b>Cold Water</b>, is a powerful and moving study of urban disaffection, female friendship and the longing for love and redemption.</p><p>Gwendoline Riley was born in 1979 and has published several successful novels: Cold Water, which won a Betty Trask Award; Joshua Spassky, which was shortlisted for the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and won the Somerset Maugham Award; and, most recently, Opposed Positions.&#x201c;Riley writes with shivering urgency, in goosebumps.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Guardian</i></p><h2>Social Limits to Growth</h2><p>Social Limits to Growth sets forth a new view of the nature and the limitations of economic growth. The authors central argument is that there are indeed limits to growth currently exist and are essentially social rather than physical. As societies have become richer, an increasing proportion of the extra goods, services, and facilities sought by consumers cannot be acquired or used by all, without spoiling them for each other. So frustration is heightened by material affluence, which is why affluence does not make a satisfied society.This book offers important insight on apparently disconnected aspects of the current malaisesuch as alienation at work, the rat-race element in education, deterioration in city living, consumerist relationships with neighbors, friends, and sex partners, as well as accelerating rates of inflation and unemployment.</p><p>No author bio available.</p><h2>Not In Vain: The inspiring story of Ellis Shipp, pioneer woman doctor.</h2><p>Under Susan McCloud&#39;s skillful hand the life story of Ellis Reynolds Shipp, the second woman doctor in Utah, becomes an engrossing drama of courage, determination, sacrifice, and fortitude.

London, Anchor Books, 2000. 12.5 x 19cm. (37), 499 pages. Original softcover. Very good condition with only minor signs of external wear. Inscribed with previous owner&#39;s name. In the century and a half since the publication of The Origin of Species, Darwin&#39;s big idea has been attacked many times, on many grounds, but has never convincingly been refuted. Yet, as Jones points out, hardly anybody reads The Origin of Species now for its science. It is celebrated as a landmark in the history of ideas, as a contribution to the philosophy of science and as a masterly work of high Victorian prose. The idea of evolution has pervaded almost every aspect of human thought. But it has almost been forgotten that it is primarily a work of science. Almost like a Whale is an attempt to redress the balance. Jones, himself a geneticist, assumes the mantle of Darwin and rewrites his masterpiece for the modern reader, borrowing the structure and thesis but writing with the benefit of 150 years&#39; hindsight. Throughout the 20th century new sciences have emerged that have in all cases buttressed the central claims of evolution, chief among them embryology and Jones&#39; own discipline of genetics. Almost Like a Whale draws widely on them for its arguments and many illuminating stories and case- studies. [Amazon]</p><p>Jones is Professor of Genetics at University College London and has worked at universities in the USA, Australia and Africa. He gave the BBC Reith Lectures in 1991, and presented a successful BBC TV series on human genetics and evolution in 1996. He is a regular columnist for the Daily Telegraph and frequently appears on radio and television. His previous books include The Language of the Genes (which won the 1994 Rhone-Poulenc Science Book Prize) and In the Blood (shortlisted for the 1997 Rhone-Poulenc). He won the 1997 Royal Society Faraday Medal for the Public Understanding of Science.&#34;&#39;Inspired by his modernising pen, the old bones throw off their dust and dance the boogie...a richly readable introduction to the science that The Origin of Species invented&#39;&#34; -- Mark Ridley * The Sunday Times * &#34;&#39;A celebration of the unarguable rightness of Darwin&#39;s case, updated to take into account our century&#39;s advances, particularly in genetics...his writing is clear, precise, declamatory, often illuminating...he allies the macro and the micro, using tales of dogs and snails and polyps and islands, to create a work of persuasion rather than polemic&#39; &#34; -- Euan Ferguson * Observer * &#34;&#39;To rewrite Darwin requires considerable skill, bravado, and, possibly, a touch of madness. Jones clearly has more than his fair share of all three...a barnstorming tour of modern genetics and its implications for evolutionary theory&#39;&#34; -- Kenan Malik * Independent on Sunday * &#34;&#39;The richness is almost overwhelming, and I am awed by Jones&#39;s reading...hugely enjoyable&#39;&#34; -- Steven Rose * Independent * &#34;&#39;Explains the workings of evolution, as they are now understood, with beautiful clarity and, naturally, with a lot more fun and jokes than Darwin ever allowed himself.

A former astronaut, Baedecker once walked on the moon, briefly escaping the tidal pull of gravity itself. Sixteen years later, gravity and other entropic forces have overtaken him. His marriage has ended. His professional life has grown increasingly meaningless. His relationship with his only son has all but disintegrated. At this critical moment, against the unlikely backdrop of Poona, India, Baedecker encounters a remarkable young woman named Maggie Brown, who will point him toward the &#x201c;places of power&#x201d; he has left behind and help him rediscover his essential self.Phases of Gravity is a novel about the power of dreams and the possibility of second chances, about journeys remembered and newly undertaken. It is also, like so much of Dan Simmons's work, a deeply affecting reflection on &#x201c;the richness and mystery of the universe.&#x201d; Moving effortlessly from the surface of the moon to the small towns of the American Midwest to the sacred Black Hills of South Dakota, and filled with wisdom, unexpected turnings, and flashes of irreverent wit, Phases of Gravity is, by any definition, a major work, the kind of durable, fully realized creation that only a master novelist could produce.Dan Simmons, a full-time public school teacher until 1987, is one of the few writers who consistently work across genres, and perhaps the only one to have won major awards in all of them. He has produced science fiction, horror, fantasy, and mainstream fiction, and is now launching stunning works in the thriller category. His first novel, <i>Song of Kali</i>, won the World Fantasy Award; his first science fiction novel, <i>Hyperion</i>, won the Hugo Award.

For Marlaud, this involves carrying out a meager existence on rue Froidevaux in Paris, tending to his father&#x2019;s grave in the cemetery across the street, and earning the outlines of a living through a part-time job at the funerary shop on the corner. It does not, however, take into account the intentions of the obese concierge of his building, who has set her widowed sights on his diminutive frame, and whose aggressive overtures are to trigger a burlesque and obscene tragedy. Originally published in 1979, <i>The High Life</i> introduces cult French author Jean-Pierre Martinet into English.

Reading like an unsettling love child of Louis-Ferdinand C�line and Jim Thompson, Martinet&#x2019;s work explores the grimly humorous possibilities of unlimited pessimism.</p><p></p><h2>On Ugliness /anglais</h2><p>This book is the follow up to the previous volume on beauty apparently beauty and ugliness are concepts that imply each other, and by ugliness we usually mean the opposite of beauty, so all we need do is define the first to understand the nature of the second but the various manifestations of ugliness over the centuries are richer and more unpredictable than is commonly thought the anthological quotations and the extraordinary illustrations in this book lead us on a surprising journey among the nightmares, terrors, and loves of almost three thousand years, where acts of rejection go hand in hand with touching gestures of compassion, and the rejection of deformity is accompanied by decadent ecstasies over the most seductive violations of all classical canons among demons, madmen, horrible enemies, and disquieting presences, among horrid abysses and deformities that verge on the sublime, among freaks and the living dead, we discover a vast and often unsuspected iconographic vein so much so that, on gradually encountering in these pages the ugliness of nature, spiritual ugliness, asymmetry, disharmony, disfigurement, and the succession of things sordid, weak, vile, banal, random, arbitrary, coarse, repugnant, clumsy, horrendous, vacuous, nauseating, criminal, spectral, witchlike, satanic, repellent, disgusting, unpleasant, grotesque, abominable, odious, crude, foul, dirty, obscene, frightening, abject, monstrous, hair-raising, ugly, terrible, terrifying, revolting, repulsive, loathsome, fetid, ignoble, awkward, ghastly and indecent, the first foreign publisher to see this book exclaimed: how beautiful ugliness is!</p><p><b>Umberto Eco</b> is a world-renowned writer of fiction, essays, and academic treatises and is undoubtedly one of the finest authors of our time. Among his best-selling novels are <i>The Name of the Rose</i>, <i>Foucault&#x2019;s Pendulum</i>, <i>The Island of the Day Before</i>, and <i>Baudolino</i>.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>INTRODUCTION <p>In every century, philosophers and artists have supplied definitions of beauty, and thanks to their works it is possible to reconstruct a history of aesthetic ideas over time. But this did not happen with ugliness. Most of the time it was defined as the opposite of beauty but almost no one ever devoted a treatise of any length to ugliness, which was relegated to passing mentions in marginal works. Hence, while a history of beauty can draw on a wide range of theoretical sources (from which we can deduce the tastes of a given epoch), for the most part a history of ugliness must seek out its own documents in the visual or verbal portrayals of things or people that are in some way seen as "ugly." Nonetheless, a history of ugliness shares some common characteristics with a history of beauty. First, we can only assume that the tastes of ordinary people corresponded in some way with the tastes of the artists of their day. If a visitor from space went into a gallery of contemporary art, and if he saw women's faces painted by Picasso and heard onlookers describing them as "beautiful," he might get the mistaken idea that in everyday life the men of our time find female creatures with faces like those painted by Picasso beautiful and desirable. But our visitor from space might modify his opinion on watching a fashion show or the Miss Universe contest, in which he would witness the celebration of other models of so-called called primitive peoples we have artistic finds but we have no theoretical texts to tell us if these were intended to cause aesthetic delight, holy fear, or hilarity. To a westerner an African ritual mask might seem hair-raising -- while for a native it might represent a benevolent divinity. Conversely, believers in some non-European religion might be disgusted by the image of Christ scourged, bleeding, and humiliated, while this apparent corporeal ugliness might arouse sympathy and emotion in a Christian. In the case of other cultures, with a wealth of poetic and philosophical texts (such as Indian, Chinese, or Japanese culture), we see images and forms but, on translating their works of literature and philosophy, it is almost always difficult to establish to what extent certain concepts can be identified with our own, although tradition has induced us to translate them into western terms such as "beautiful" or "ugly." Even if the translations were reliable, it would not be enough to know that in a certain culture something that possesses, for example, proportion and harmony, was seen as beautiful. Proportion and harmony. What do we mean by these terms? Even in the course of western history their meaning has changed. It is only by comparing theoretical statements with a picture or an architectonic structure from the period that we notice that what was considered proportionate in one century was no longer seen as such in another; on the subject of proportion, for example, a medieval philosopher would think of the dimensions and the form of a Gothic cathedral, while a Renaissance theoretician would think of a sixteenth-century temple, whose parts were governed by the golden section -- and Renaissance man saw the proportions of cathedrals as barbarous, as the term "Gothic" amply suggests. Concepts of beauty and ugliness are relative to various historical periods or various cultures and, to quote Xenophanes of Colophon (according to Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, V, 110), "But had the oxen or the lions hands, or could with hands depict a work like men, were beasts to draw the semblance of the gods, the horses would them like to horses sketch, to oxen, oxen, and their bodies make of such a shape as to themselves belongs."</p></p><h2>Night Tremors (The Rick Cahill Series)</h2><p><br>2016 ANTHONY AWARD NOMINEE FOR BEST NOVEL<br>2016 SHAMUS AWARD NOMINEE FOR BEST FIRST PI NOVEL<br>2016 LEFTY AWARD FINALIST FOR BEST REGIONAL MYSTERY<br>Nightmares of the man he killed two years ago still chase Rick Cahill through his sleep.

Having learned to combine human strategy with superior (although captured) technology, a Posleen overlord threatens to break through into unoccupied human territory. Opposing this effort are Major Mike O'Neal and his battalion of armored combat suits, plus conventional armor units lead by a Brobdingnagian mobile gun with a razor-wielding cartoon rabbit emblazoned on its side. The battle scenes are as vivid as ever, but the consequences lie more heavily than before on the warriors, as when O'Neal approves a nuclear strike near where his remaining family are located in order to save his command. It becomes increasingly clear that some alien "allies" would prefer that the humans and Posleens destroy one another and leave the galactic status quo undisturbed. Attentive readers may notice some overlap with When the Devil Dances, which Ringo explains in an afterword. Despite the overall dark tone, the author's trademark gallows humor shines through ("This is what you get for letting rednecks play with antimatter, boss"). So does a bit of hope: Ringo concludes his afterword by asserting "the good guys always win in the end." <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Written in My Hearts Own Blood</h2><p><b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER �&nbsp;<b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>BOOKLIST</i></b></b><br><br>In her now classic novel <i>Outlander, </i>Diana Gabaldon told the story of Claire Randall, an English ex-combat nurse who walks through a stone circle in the Scottish Highlands in 1946, and disappears . . . into 1743.

A small clearing, out of the way, up among a scatter of great lichened boulders, under the shadow of firs and at the foot of a big red cedar; a place where no casual passerby would go, but not inaccessible. He meant to bring them up here&#x2014;the family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fergus, to begin with. Maybe just Fergus, by himself. Mam had raised Fergus from the time he was ten, and he&#x2019;d had no mother before that. Fergus had known Mam longer than Ian had, and loved her as much. <i>Maybe more,</i> he thought, his grief aggravated by guilt. Fergus had stayed with her at Lally�broch, helped to take care of her and the place; he hadn&#x2019;t. He swallowed hard and, walking into the small clear space, set his stone in the middle, then stood back to look.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even as he did so, he found himself shaking his head. No, it had to be two cairns. His mam and Uncle Jamie were brother and sister, and the family could mourn them here together&#x2014;but there were others he might bring, maybe, to remember and pay their respects. And those were the folk who would have known Jamie Fraser and loved him well but wouldn&#x2019;t ken Jenny Murray from a hole in the&#x2014;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The image of his mother <i>in</i> a hole in the ground stabbed him like a fork, retreated with the recollection that she wasn&#x2019;t after all in a grave, and stabbed again all the harder for that. He really couldn&#x2019;t bear the vision of them drowning, maybe clinging to each other, struggling to keep&#x2014;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x201c;A Dhia!&#x201d;</i> he said violently, and dropped the stone, turning back at once to find more. He&#x2019;d seen people drown.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tears ran down his face with the sweat of the summer day; he didn&#x2019;t mind it, only stopping now and then to wipe his nose on his sleeve. He&#x2019;d tied a rolled kerchief round his head to keep the hair and the stinging sweat out of his eyes; it was sopping before he&#x2019;d added more than twenty stones to each of the cairns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He and his brothers had built a fine cairn for their father before he died, at the head of the carved stone that bore his name&#x2014;all his names, in spite of the expense&#x2014;in the burying ground at Lallybroch. And then later, at the funeral, members of the family, followed by the tenants and then the servants, had come one by one to add a stone each to the weight of remembrance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fergus, then. Or&nbsp;. . . no, what was he thinking? Auntie Claire must be the first he brought here. She wasn&#x2019;t Scots herself, but she kent fine what a cairn was and would maybe be comforted a bit to see Uncle Jamie&#x2019;s. Aye, right. Auntie Claire, then Fergus. Uncle Jamie was Fergus&#x2019;s foster father; he had a right. And then maybe Marsali and the children. But maybe Germain was old enough to come with Fergus? He was ten, near enough to being a man to understand, to be treated like a man. And Uncle Jamie was his grandsire; it was proper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stepped back again and wiped his face, breathing heavily. Bugs whined and buzzed past his ears and hovered over him, wanting his blood, but he&#x2019;d stripped to a loincloth and rubbed himself with bear grease and mint in the Mohawk way; they didn&#x2019;t touch him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Look over them, O spirit of red cedar,&#x201d; he said softly in Mohawk, gazing up into the fragrant branches of the tree. &#x201c;Guard their souls and keep their presence here, fresh as thy branches.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He crossed himself and bent to dig about in the soft leaf mold. A few more rocks, he thought. In case they might be scattered by some passing animal. Scattered like his thoughts, which roamed restless to and fro among the faces of his family, the folk of the Ridge&#x2014;God, might he ever go back there? Brianna. Oh, Jesus, Brianna&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He bit his lip and tasted salt, licked it away and moved on, foraging. She was safe with Roger Mac and the weans. But, Jesus, he could have used her advice&#x2014;even more, Roger Mac&#x2019;s.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Who was left for him to ask, if he needed help in taking care of them all?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thought of Rachel came to him, and the tightness in his chest eased a little. Aye, if he had Rachel&nbsp;. . . She was younger than him, nay more than nineteen, and, being a Quaker, had very strange notions of how things should be, but if he had her, he&#x2019;d have solid rock under his feet. He hoped he <i>would</i> have her, but there were still things he must say to her, and the thought of that conversation made the tightness in his chest come back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The picture of his cousin Brianna came back, too, and lingered in his mind: tall, long-nosed and strong-boned as her father&nbsp;. . . and with it rose the image of his <i>other</i> cousin, Bree&#x2019;s half brother. Holy God, William. And what ought he to do about William? He doubted the man kent the truth, kent that he was Jamie Fraser&#x2019;s son&#x2014;was it Ian&#x2019;s responsibility to tell him so? To bring him here and explain what he&#x2019;d lost?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He must have groaned at the thought, for his dog, Rollo, lifted his massive head and looked at him in concern.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I dinna ken that, either,&#x201d; Ian told him. &#x201c;Let it bide, aye?&#x201d; Rollo laid his head back on his paws, shivered his shaggy hide against the flies, and relaxed in boneless peace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ian worked awhile longer and let the thoughts drain away with his sweat and his tears. He finally stopped when the sinking sun touched the tops of his cairns, feeling tired but more at peace. The cairns rose knee-high, side by side, small but solid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stood still for a bit, not thinking anymore, just listening to the fussing of wee birds in the grass and the breathing of the wind among the trees. Then he sighed deeply, squatted, and touched one of the cairns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Tha gaol agam oirbh, a Mh�thair,&#x201d;</i> he said softly. <i>My love is upon you, Mother.</i> Closed his eyes and laid a scuffed hand on the other heap of stones. The dirt ground into his skin made his fingers feel strange, as though he could maybe reach straight through the earth and touch what he needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stayed still, breathing, then opened his eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Help me wi&#x2019; this, Uncle Jamie,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I dinna think I can manage, alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>2</b></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Dirty Bastard</b></p><p></p><p>W</p><p>illiam Ransom, Ninth Earl of Ellesmere, Viscount Ashness, Baron Derwent, shoved his way through the crowds on Market Street, oblivious to the complaints of those rebounding from his impact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t know where he was going, or what he might do when he got there.

I was dimly aware that I was smiling like a loon, despite massive destruction, horrific scenes, William&#x2019;s distress&#x2014;if you could call an explosion like that &#x201c;distress&#x201d;&#x2014;Jamie&#x2019;s danger, and a faint wonder as to what either Jenny or Mrs.&nbsp;Figg, Lord John&#x2019;s cook and housekeeper, might be about to say.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mrs.&nbsp;Figg was smoothly spherical, gleamingly black, and inclined to glide silently up behind one like a menacing ball bearing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s <i>this</i>?&#x201d; she barked, manifesting herself suddenly behind Jenny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Holy Mother of God!&#x201d; Jenny whirled, eyes round and hand pressed to her chest. &#x201c;Who in God&#x2019;s name are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This is Mrs.&nbsp;Figg,&#x201d; I said, feeling a surreal urge to laugh, despite&#x2014;or maybe because of&#x2014;recent events. &#x201c;Lord John Grey&#x2019;s cook. And, Mrs.&nbsp;Figg, this is Mrs.&nbsp;Murray. My, um&nbsp;. . . my&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Your good-sister,&#x201d; Jenny said firmly. She raised one black eyebrow. &#x201c;If ye&#x2019;ll have me still?&#x201d; Her look was straight and open, and the urge to laugh changed abruptly into an equally strong urge to burst into tears. Of all the unlikely sources of succor I could have imagined&nbsp;. . . I took a deep breath and put out my hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have you.&#x201d; We hadn&#x2019;t parted on good terms in Scotland, but I had loved her very much, once, and wasn&#x2019;t about to pass up any opportunity to mend things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her small firm fingers wove through mine, squeezed hard, and, as simply as that, it was done. No need for apologies or spoken forgiveness. She&#x2019;d never had to wear the mask that Jamie did. What she thought and felt was there in her eyes, those slanted blue cat eyes she shared with her brother. She knew the truth now of what I was, and she knew I loved&#x2014;and always had loved&#x2014;her brother with all my heart and soul&#x2014;despite the minor complications of my being presently married to someone else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She heaved a sigh, eyes closing for an instant, then opened them and smiled at me, mouth trembling only a little.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, fine and dandy,&#x201d; said Mrs.&nbsp;Figg shortly. She narrowed her eyes and rotated smoothly on her axis, taking in the panorama of destruction. The railing at the top of the stair had been ripped off, and cracked banisters, dented walls, and bloody smudges marked the path of William&#x2019;s descent. Shattered crystals from the chandelier littered the floor, glinting festively in the light that poured through the open front door, the door itself cracked through and hanging drunkenly from one hinge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Merde</i> on toast,&#x201d; Mrs.&nbsp;Figg murmured. She turned abruptly to me, her small black-currant eyes still narrowed. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s his lordship?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; I said. This was going to be rather sticky, I saw. While deeply disapproving of most people, Mrs.&nbsp;Figg was devoted to John. She wasn&#x2019;t going to be at all pleased to hear that he&#x2019;d been abducted by&#x2014;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;For that matter, where&#x2019;s my brother?&#x201d; Jenny inquired, glancing round as though expecting Jamie to appear suddenly out from under the settee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Hmm. Well&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; Possibly worse than sticky. Because&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And where&#x2019;s my Sweet William?&#x201d; Mrs.&nbsp;Figg demanded, sniffing the air. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been here; I smell that stinky cologne he puts on his linen.&#x201d; She nudged a dislodged chunk of plaster disapprovingly with the toe of her shoe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I took another long, deep breath and a tight grip on what remained of my sanity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs.&nbsp;Figg,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;perhaps you would be so kind as to make us all a cup of tea?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We sat in the parlor, while Mrs.&nbsp;Figg came and went to the cookhouse, keeping an eye on her terrapin stew.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to scorch turtle, no, you don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she said severely to us, setting down the teapot in its padded yellow cozy on her return. &#x201c;Not with so much sherry as his lordship likes in it. Almost a full bottle&#x2014;terrible waste of good liquor, that would be.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My insides turned over promptly. Turtle soup&#x2014;with a lot of sherry&#x2014;had certain strong and private associations for me, these being connected with Jamie, feverish delirium, and the way in which a heaving ship assists sexual intercourse. Contemplation of which would <i>not</i> assist the impending discussion in the slightest. I rubbed a finger between my brows, in hopes of dispelling the buzzing cloud of confusion gathering there. The air in the house still felt electric.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Cooking With Heart in Hand</h2><p>Book by Worsham, Suzanne Winningham, Ward, Suzanne, Heart in Hand Inc</p><p></p><h2>Home Front: A Novel</h2><p><p>In her bestselling novels Kristin Hannah has plumbed the depths of friendship, the loyalty of sisters, and the secrets mothers keep.

All families have wounds. All wars have a cost. . . .</i></p><p>Like many couples, Michael and Jolene Zarkades have to face the pressures of everyday life---children, careers, bills, chores---even as their twelve-year marriage is falling apart. Then an unexpected deployment sends Jolene deep into harm's way and leaves defense attorney Michael at home, unaccustomed to being a single parent to their two girls. As a mother, it agonizes Jolene to leave her family, but as a solider she has always understood the true meaning of duty. In her letters home, she paints a rose-colored version of her life on the front lines, shielding her family from the truth. But war will change Jolene in ways that none of them could have foreseen. When tragedy strikes, Michael must face his darkest fear and fight a battle of his own---for everything that matters to his family.</p><p>At once a profoundly honest look at modern marriage and a dramatic exploration of the toll war takes on an ordinary American family, <i>Home Front</i> is a story of love, loss, heroism, honor, and ultimately, hope.</p></p><p><p><b>Delilah Reflects On What Makes <em>Home Front</em> Great</b></p> <p><b>A "best friend" to millions of women, Delilah blends 5 hours of music with listener call-ins, personal anecdotes, and interviews with top artists, touching lives and giving comfort through music.

Her selfless act of enrolling in our National Guard hints at that and her selflessness, and that act alone changes her life forever. And that of her family, forever.</p> <p>What Jolene discovers in herself is an amazing ability to use her intellect and instincts to be a true hero in the middle of a war, and to carry the burdens of what so many of our men and women experience in wartime.

This was accomplished by Rudolf Steiner not just in a theoretical sense but also practically, and came about through the establishing of a path, accessible to all human beings, which leads to a union with the forces of the Resurrection body.&#x201d;<br><br>Sergei Prokofieff approaches the deepest mysteries of the Turning Point of Time (the Christ event) through Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s spiritual research. At its heart stands the question of the restoration of the &#x201c;phantom&#x201d; of the physical body and its transformation into the resurrected body of Christ through the Mystery of Golgotha. The author draws a broad and differentiated picture of the tasks and possibilities that the Easter event&#x2015;as well as Ascension and Pentecost&#x2015;present, both for the individual and humanity. <br><br>The final chapter considers the mystery of Easter Saturday, through which the two polar aspects of the Mystery of Golgotha&#x2015;death and resurrection&#x2015;interconnect, also explaining the relationship between the Earth Spirit and the interior of the Earth. An appendix tackles the phenomenon of stigmatization from a spiritual-scientific perspective.</p><p><b>Sergei O. Prokofieff</b> (1954-2014) was born in Moscow, where he studied fine arts and painting at the Moscow School of Art. At an early age he encountered the work of Rudolf Steiner and quickly realized that his life would be dedicated to the Christian path of esoteric knowledge. He wrote his first book, <i>Rudolf Steiner and the Founding of the New Mysteries,</i> while living in Soviet Russia, and it was published in English in 1994. After the fall of Communism, he helped establish the Anthroposophical Society in Russia. In 2001, he became a member of the Executive Council of the General Anthroposophical Society at the Goetheanum in Switzerland. More than 30 of his books have been translated into English. Sergei Prokofieff passed away in Dornach, Switzerland.<br><br><b>Simon Blaxland de Lange</b> has for many years worked as an educator for people with special needs. He is also a prolific writer and translator and an amateur musician and gardener. Blaxland de Lange helped establish Pericles Translations and Research, Pericles Training and Work (for adults with special needs), and the Pericles Theatre Company. Together with Dr Vivian Law, he cofounded the Humanities Research Group in 1997 and the British group of the Humanities Section of the School of Spiritual Science in 1998. He met Owen Barfield in 1979, and has been a student of his work for the past thirty years.SERGEI O. PROKOFIEFF, born in Moscow in 1954, studied painting and art history at the Moscow School of Art. He encountered anthroposophy in his youth, and soon made the decision to devote his life to it. He has been active as an author and lecturer since 1982, and in 1991 he co-founded the Anthroposophical Society in Russia.

Many cowboys faded into history, but some discovered "the last frontier," a place in northwest Colorado and northeast Utah that still prized their skills. Ora Haley, owner of the vast Two-Bar Ranch and Cattle Company, was the last of the Cattle Kings, and this was his domain. <p>Val FitzPatrick's family homesteaded in this region, and Val became a rider for the Two-Bar at the age of 14. In later years, Val wrote many accounts of his life, and "The Arbuckle Cafe" is a collection of the best of his stories, all classic and authentic insights of what life on the range was really like. These stories are entertaining glimpses into lives as honest as a well-looped riata, lives that vacillated between adventure and boredom, the lives of the real cowpunchers.</p></p><p>Even though I grew up in the cattle country of northwest Colorado, it wasn't until just a few years ago that I had my first sip of Arbuckles' Coffee, the original "buckaroo brew." After a mellow day of trail riding, we'd decided to kick back around the campfire for a spell, warm-up some canned beans, and see who could spin the best yarn. This turned out to be an appropriate setting for learning about the java that "won the West." <p>As the evening wore on and the pinyon fire settled down to a comfortable glow of hot embers, one of the old-timers posed a tricky question: "Go back one-hundred years. Who do you suppose was considered the most famous and best-known hero in the Old West? Whose autograph was most valuable?" </p><p>We each had our guess-maybe the Governor of Colorado, Alva Adams? Was it Cleveland, the U.S. President? Chief Ouray of the Utes? Otto Mears, the road builder? After we'd exhausted every name we could remember, we gave up and the old-timer answered his own question. "It was Arbuckle. Everybody-men, women, children-knew of Arbuckle. His name was known in the lowliest dugout and in the best log house, in freighters' camps, on roundups, in trappers' tents, and in prospectors' shelters. Arbuckle's signature was the most treasured autograph ever known. Everyone drank toasts to him." </p><p> "Who was Arbuckle?" we asked. </p><p>The old fellow, enjoying his role as historian, answered, "Arbuckle was the man whose signature appeared on the one-pound paper packages of coffee used by everybody. Arbuckles' "Ariosa" was the only coffee known on the frontier for many years. The price was 20 cents a pound, and Arbuckle was the first merchandiser to offer premiums." </p><p>He paused as if to remember, then continued, "On each package of coffee, running lengthwise, was the scrawled signature of Arbuckle. Cut out the signatures, save them, and in due course for a certain number of signatures and a little money you could get such things as scissors, jackknives, mirrors, comb-and-brush sets, razors, and perfumes, not to mention mouse traps, jaw harps, napkin rings, and mustache cups." </p><p>That old-timer indeed knew Arbuckles well, for he was Val FitzPatrick, once a cowpuncher for the famous Two-Bar outfit at the turn of the century. He'd had his share of the strong brew, we were sure. </p><p>Out West, Arbuckles' coffee was a success with chuck-wagon cooks, who were faced with the task of keeping cowpunchers supplied with plenty of hot "mud" out on the range. As enticement to buy Arbuckles' Coffee, a stick of peppermint was included in every package of Ariosa. This became a powerful tool for the camp cookee to bribe cowpunchers to help with chores. The chuck-wagon cook was well-respected, for anything otherwise might lead to "dehorned coffee" or "water that's been scalded to death." Sears carried bags of the coffee in their famous mail-order catalogs at 20 cents a pound. </p><p>Arbuckles became so common that by 1890 it had became a generic name for coffee. It was common to hear cowpunchers ask for a cup of coffee by saying, "How about them Arbuckles?" And a good cowpuncher was "worth his weight in Arbuckles." One old cowpuncher said he made "cowdog coffee" out of Ariosa. When asked what "cowdog coffee" was, he replied: "It's just like cowboy coffee, you boil Arbuckles in a pan over a fire for a few hours, then you throw in a hoss shoe, and if it won't sink, it's done. Add a little whiskey. Makes you howl." Variants on this recipe were once found across the West (often you'd throw in a six-shooter). Another cowpuncher said, "Most people don't realize how little water it takes to make good coffee. Probably not all that nutritious, though, without much water." </p><p>But truly, the most widely known man on the frontier, even more well-known than General Custer, was Arbuckle. And many a cowpuncher and many a waddie spent many an hour telling tales by firelight at the Arbuckle Cafe, served by a surly waiter called Cookee. </p><p>I sincerely hope you enjoy this collection of stories by Val FitzPatrick and have many pleasant evenings at the Arbuckle Cafe.</p>Anytime a cowpuncher brewed a cup of java, the &#34;Arbuckle Cafe&#34; was open for business. Rain or shine, both friend and stranger were welcome to a hot steaming cup of coffee and a good story or two. Arbuckle&#39;s Ariosa coffee was the preferred drink of the range, and many a waddie warmed himself with the buckaroo brew before a long night guard with the dogies. Val FitzPatrick was a cowboy with the famous Two Bar outfit in northwest Colorado. &#34;The Arbuckle Cafe&#34; tells what it was really like to be a cowpuncher on one of the West&#39;s last frontiers.</p><h2>Deadpool Kills Deadpool</h2><p>The final act of the Deadpool Killogy begins!

To primp and preen over their wealth, to lord their position over their "lessers," or to condescend to snobbery&#x2014;the province of the newly rich&#x2014;would have never occurred to John Faucheraud Grimk� or the other gentlemen sons of South Carolina's great families. Such behavior would have been unseemly, undignified. White Charleston society was instead a world apart, a community of wealth, custom, and privilege built on the English model. Its oldest families, who were descended from the original settlers brought to the Carolinas from Britain in 1669 under the watchful eye of Lord Proprietor Sir Anthony Ashley-Cooper, had become the denizens of a new class of cotton, indigo, and rice wealth. Endowed with such a distinguished pedigree (their ancestors had been sent to the New World by their king, Charles II, himself), they affected what they believed to be the aristocratic manner of their British cousins. Their belief in their way of life, and in their right to live that life as they pleased, formed the central tenet of their faith.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the Ashley and Cooper rivers (which join, Charlestonians say, "to form the Atlantic Ocean"), the Pinckneys, Gaillards, Alstons, Draytons, Smiths, Laurenses, Lowndeses, Middletons, Hugers, Rutgerses, and Grimk�s built homes with tall wooden doors and ornate black iron gates, behind which well-attired slaves served cool drinks or tended gardens that imitated those ofEngland's noble estates. Everything about Charleston bespoke its standing as the South's greatest city&#x2014;if not in size, then in status and stature. By 1800, with a population of twenty thousand&#x2014;a mere 150 years after its first one hundred families landed at the spit of land named Oyster Point&#x2014;Charleston was the South's premier port and America's fourth-largest urban area. Its harbor was crowded with ships bound for Britain, France, the Northern states, and Africa. Charleston exported tobacco, rice, cotton, indigo, and lumber and imported textiles, furniture, and slaves.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A visitor to Charleston in 1800 would have been impressed by the city's understated magnificence; it was as subtle and majestic as any midsize British town but without the seedy clutter. It was only a short carriage ride from the outskirts, down the tree-lined cobblestoned streets and past the homes of Charleston's most affluent citizens, to the center of the city, which was located on a flat peninsula. There, Charleston's banks, dry-goods stores, artisan shops, and law, municipal, and state offices were grouped along two dozen streets that led down to the city park, near the "battery." Young men and women, courting, strolled each summer evening along the waterfront, often accompanied by servants. There were benches in the park, set among oak, maple, and cypress trees planted by the first settlers. If laughter was heard, it was restrained; the more boisterous voices, from the docks, were muted by the long row of offices on the southern side of the city center. On the other side of the city, separated from the affluent homes by a creek, a small group of middle- and lower-class homes jutted up against the modest post office. Nearby were the slave pens, to which men, women, and children from Africa were brought after being quarantined and before being sold to the wealthy planters and those in need of house servants.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of Charleston's best-known and best-appointed offices (in a nondescript brick building just two blocks from the slave pens) was managed by John Phillips and John Gardner, Rhode Island-born entrepreneurs who hired the captains and leased the ships that transported the slaves to Charleston. In just four short years, between 1803 (when Charleston reopened its overseas slave trade after a legislated hiatus that dated from the end of the American Revolution) and 1807 (when America's international trade in slaves was stopped forever), the firm of Phillips &amp; Gardner reaped a windfall in profits from its imports. In that period, nearly forty thousand Africans landed on Charleston's shores, to be dispatched inland by wagon or sent north along the middle Atlantic coast aboard ships to their new masters. Charlestonians were careful in their trade. Arriving slaves were quarantined for ten days on Sullivan's Island, outside Charleston Harbor, before being transferred to the slave pens. By 1810, the flood of overseas slaves had ended, but the effect was permanent: a majority of South Carolinians were now black, and parts of the state were so inundated by the trade that whites made up only a small portion of the population.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The large home of Judge John Faucheraud Grimk� and his wife, Mary Smith Grimk�, on Front Street, was a short drive from Saint Philip's Church. When the services ended, the judge and his children, in separate carriages, would ride back to their home and receive guests, as was their Sunday custom. Sometimes, in the evening, the Grimk�s would join other parishioners in a special prayer service, or else take part in an event at the central venue of Charleston's civic life, the Old Exchange Building, which looked out over the harbor. The Old Exchange served as the setting for the city's political activity, hosting a regular round of lectures, campaign speeches on patriotic or religious themes emphasizing "right thinking" and "correct morals," and appropriately noncontroversial public discussions about local matters. The Grimk� family spent other Sunday evenings calling on close friends at plantations along the Ashley River, northwest of the city, where the Middletons and Draytons had palatial homes. But even as a child, Sarah Grimk�, the judge's second daughter and sixth child, preferred teaching Sunday religious classes for slave children to making social visits with her family to Charleston's elite. Sarah was a gifted teacher, though she was frustrated by the fact that she was forced to give her lessons verbally, since Charleston's slaves were forbidden to learn how to read. More comfortable with children than with adults, the nervous young woman became an excellent storyteller. She was at ease with her young charges and believed that their innocence was God's way of reflecting the original state of man.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christmas, Easter, and Independence Day were the most important holidays in Charleston. For South Carolinians, July 4 was particularly special, and the city took great pride in its festivities. Charleston had suffered grievously during the American Revolution, when the British Army had imprisoned the sons of some of the city's great families in the "dungeon" (preserved for posterity as a museum beneath the Old Exchange Building). On Independence Day, families from South Carolina's up-country plantations would come to Charleston to enjoy the city fair and watch the fireworks that the municipal committee put on around the harbor. The citizenry relived the day when American troops had reoccupied Charleston after Washington's stunning victory at Yorktown. Charlestonians and their up-country "cousins" spread their picnic blankets in the park and greeted old friends as children played and gawked at the soldiers of the South Carolina Militia, resplendent in their uniforms. The militia was the pride of Charleston, a permanent symbol of its contribution to the founding of the young Republic. But even as Charleston celebrated its independence, it took pride in vestigial evidence of its colonial past&#x2014;streets, lined with trees and six-foot-wide brick walks, that were still named George and King.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The highlight of each July 4 came when Charleston's families gathered in Battery Park to witness the firing of the set of cannons that looked out over the harbor. Just as they had once been fired to stave off Blackbeard, whose pirates had threatened the city in 1718, and the British invaders, whose ships had been spotted outside the harbor in 1780, so now they memorialized the birth of independence, sending their shells out into the middle distance, toward the walls of the fort that guarded the city. This seemingly impregnable gray eminence blocking Charleston Harbor was named for Thomas Sumter, a dashing Revolutionary War cavalryman and friend of John Grimk�'s. Sumter and Francis Marion, another famous partisan, were the state's premier heroes and, as the "Gamecock" and the "Swamp Fox," the twin icons of its legendary struggle with royalty, having fought the British from their low-country lairs in a series of hit-and-run cavalry raids. Fort Sumter was as much a symbol of Charleston's fighting spirit as the city's homes were symbols of its elegance&#x2014;and it seemed no less invincible than South Carolina society. Both would stand forever. When the firing of the militia's artillery stopped, and the last of the shells had burst out over the fort, the applause of the onlookers rang into the night, and Charleston's families turned for home, secure in their independence and confident in their future.</p><p><br></p><p>* * *</p><p><br></p><p>The Grimk�s and others like them practiced an easy patriotism born of the certainty that no one, ever, could question their right to command the society that their ancestors had created. So assured were they in their position that in 1810, when Sarah Grimk� was eighteen, the state legislature (called the House of Commons in a bow to English pretensions) passed legislation granting all white males the right to vote, well in advance of similar measures passed by legislatures in the rest of the country. The real reason for such liberalism was that in South Carolina, the right to vote meant little. Through a series of legislative sleights-of-hand, the administration of the state was firmly controlled by a small group of rich and influential low-country planters, a class to which John Grimk� and his family belonged. The legislation merely ensured that the House of Commons would retain its monarchial privileges, claiming the right to appoint all the state's judges, presidential electors, and officeholders, including the governor. The institution of slavery was jealously guarded by the House, since nearly all of its members owned slaves. South Carolina was the nation's only true "slavocracy."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South Carolina's constitution was derived from a unique document of colonial history. "The Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina" was written by Lord Ashley with the help of his personal secretary John Locke. The aristocratic Locke was a learned but unpretentious empiricist Englishman who won immortality by helping to create that most breathtaking of all beliefs, the notion that the people had a right to choose their own government. The constitution drafted by Ashley and Locke was nonetheless at some remove from true republicanism: while it emphasized religious tolerance, which appealed to the French Huguenots (one of Charleston's most prominent lineages), it also established an economic system that encouraged large land grants, which appealed to its English-descended gentry. (Locke, known for his suggestion that some revolutions were necessary, was much less revolutionary than Americans then believed: he held considerable stock in the Royal Africa Company, whose business was the slave trade.) South Carolina's government elected legislators who institutionalized the status of South Carolina's small but affluent nobility. Charleston's citizens constantly celebrated their independence, their love of liberty, and their individual self-reliance, though in fact they were the least disposed to grant those same privileges to anyone else. Charleston was not a city of immigrants, of huddled masses, or of oppressed yearning to be free, nor was it destined to become one. After the initial influx of Huguenots and Englishmen, the town fathers had enacted strict citizenship laws that choked off the flow of new settlers (excepting slaves from Africa), even as they insisted that theirs was a friendly city that would welcome anyone.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these reasons, Charleston was an anomaly, different not only from the rest of America but even from the rest of the South. During the crush of westward settlement that marked the opening of cotton lands following Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin, in 1794, Charleston's elite remained remarkably unaffected by the new South's cotton wealth. Life went on as before, with the exception that those low-country planters who refused to cash in on cotton began to live on borrowed time and borrowed money. But if a handful of Charleston's elite families started to lose their riches, they nevertheless retained their power in the state and city, and their status as South Carolina's leading citizens. The silent, all-knowing, even self-deprecating style that the members of Charleston's elite feigned in imitation of their London cousins stayed firmly in place; they were guaranteed their continued high standing by a system that was, as one aging and disenchanted Charlestonian would later bitterly reflect, "rocked in the cradle of wealth."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing intruded on this easy life. The national government was far away, and the state government solidly in the hands of the ruling class; even slavery itself, while an ever-present reality, seemed a distant concern. In truth, the heads of Charleston's most affluent families had little contact with any but the most trusted of their slaves&#x2014;those who cooked the family meals or raised the family's children. Few heads of such families ever lowered themselves to the direct, day-to-day management of their plantations. That was left to overseers. Only on rare occasions, when their lives or livelihoods were threatened by precipitously falling profits or, even more unusually, rumors of a slave insurrection did Charleston's ruling fathers intervene in the daily existence of their chattel property.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; White women, the ruling matrons of Charleston society, had much more contact with slaves than their husbands, but that contact was of a particular kind. Although white women might be considered the "mistresses" of their domain, they were in fact as dependent on black domestic servants as their husbands were on overseers. House slaves invariably knew more about raising children and disciplining them than the Huger, Pinckney, Smith, or Grimk� women, since such matters were left almost exclusively in their hands. So it was, on both counts, that the young male and female progeny of Charleston's elite were planted and pruned to imitate this life-style, trained not as enterprising and creative innovators wedded to the idea of progress, but as "managers" of a status quo that was as fanatically defended as it was universally unquestioned.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early 1800s, the Grimk� family grew and prospered. John Faucheraud Grimk� was as talented and innovative a businessman as had been his paternal grandfather, the silversmith John Paul Grimk�. Originally from Alsace-Lorraine and German by birth, the first American Grimk� had spoken with a German accent and added an � to his name, giving it a French cast. His decision to change the family name, if only slightly, was intended to appeal to the sensibilities of Charleston's mo...</p></p><h2>As Time Goes By (Mulligan Sisters)</h2><p>In 1942 San Francisco, war has touched every part of the Mulligans lives.

He has published nine novels and several non-fiction books in 35 languages. He has written and performed for the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford, England, and in 2001 resumed his practice as a visual artist, with exhibitions worldwide.Newcomer Coupland sheds light on an often overlooked segment of the population: "Generation X," the post-baby boomers who must endure "legislated nostalgia (to force a body of people to have memories they do not actually own)" and who indulge in "knee-jerk irony (the tendency to make flippant ironic comments as a reflexive matter of course . . . )." These are just two of the many terse, bitterly on-target observations and cartoons that season the margins of the text. The plot frames a loose Decameron -style collection of "bedtime stories" told by three friends, Dag, Andy and Claire, who have fled society for the relative tranquility of Palm Springs. They fantasize about nuclear Armageddon and the mythical but drab Texlahoma, located on an asteroid, where it is forever 1974. The true stories they relate are no less strange: Dag tells a particularly haunting tale about a Japanese businessman whose most prized possession, tragically, is a photo of Marilyn Monroe flashing. These stories, alternatively touching and hilarious, reveal the pain beneath the kitschy veneer of 1940s mementos and taxidermied chickens. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>HUNTING &amp; AMERICAN IMAGINATION</h2><p>The historic image of the American hunter, clad in buckskin and carrying a rifle, is a cultural icon. But as Daniel Herman finds in Hunting and the American Imagination, America&#39;s hunting tradition did not spring solely from the colonial or frontier experience. By tracing American hunters&#39; ideas about who they were and what they represented, Herman shows how Americans claimed a continent and forged enduring ideas about manliness, race, and nation. Far from seeing themselves as a society of hunters, colonists and early Americans defined themselves as farmers and builders of civilization. Although hunting was a part of frontier life, most Americans viewed it as a matter of subsistence rather than a mark of identity. In the nineteenth century, however, largely through the efforts of writers and artists, hunter-explorers like Davy Crockett and Meriwether Lewis became heroes to the men of a growing and increasingly urban middle class. Whether they subscribed to the democratic legend of Daniel Boone or the hunting-with-hounds tradition of European aristocrats, America&#39;s sport hunters ultimately saw themselves as self-reliant &#34;American Natives.&#34; Hunters identified with the Native Americans they had displaced and claimed to be heirs of the continent and natural stewards over its land and wildlife. The story of America&#39;s hunting heritage is more than a story of crosshairs and prey. It is a tale of imagination and identity. From John Smith to Theodore Roosevelt, the experiences of American hunters provide a rich legacy that continues to inform the conservation movement and fundamental ideas about American rights today.</p><p></p><h2>Inventing Elsa Maxwell: How an Irrepressible Nobody Conquered High Society, Hollywood, the Press, and the World</h2><p><p>One of the twentieth century's most colorful characters brought back to life in this biography by the author of <i>All About All About Eve</i></p><p>With <i>Inventing Elsa Maxwell</i>, Sam Staggs has crafted a landmark biography. Elsa Maxwell (1881-1963) invented herself&#x2013;not once, but repeatedly. Built like a bulldog, she ascended from the San Francisco middle class to the heights of society in New York, London, Paris, Venice, and Monte Carlo. Shunning boredom and predictability, Elsa established herself as party-giver extraordinaire in Europe with come-as-you-are parties, treasure hunts (e.g., retrieve a slipper from the foot of a singer at the Casino de Paris), and murder parties that drew the ire of the British parliament. She set New York a-twitter with her soirees at the Waldorf, her costume parties, and her headline-grabbing guest lists of the rich and royal, movie stars, society high and low, and those on the make all mixed together in let-'er-rip gaiety. All the while, Elsa dashed off newspaper columns, made films in Hollywood, wrote bestselling books, and turned up on TV talk shows. She hobnobbed with friends like Noel Coward and Cole Porter. Late in life, she fell in love with Maria Callas, who spurned her and broke Elsa's heart. Her feud with the Duchess of Windsor made headlines for three years in the 1950s. </p><p><i>Inventing Elsa Maxwell</i>, the first biography of this extraordinary woman, tells the witty story of a life lived out loud.</p></p><p><p>SAM STAGGS is the author of five books, including four biographies of movies: <i>All About</i> <i>All About Eve</i>, <i>Close-Up</i> <i>on Sunset</i> <i>Boulevard, When Blanche Met Brando</i>, and <i>Born to be Hurt</i>.

Those are varicose veins.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I first met Elsa Maxwell in the summer of 1922. I found her dynamic, gay, bursting with energy, courageous, insanely generous and, to me, always kind. <br>&#x2014;No�l Coward, in his introduction to Elsa Maxwell&#x2019;s last book, <i>The Celebrity Circus,</i> 1963 <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>&#x201c;Elsa was one of my aversions,&#x201d; Walter Winchell wrote in his memoir. &#x201c;Now along comes Mr. Paar and makes a brand-new life and career for Elsa, who&#x2019;d publicly announced that she had &#x2018;never had a man in her life.&#x2019; <br>&#x201c;The Lez said about it, the better.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>While filming <i>The Black Rose</i> on location in England in 1950, Tyrone Power sent a picture postcard to Clifton Webb back in Hollywood.

Conroy, an underling at the FBI, dated July 26, 1945: <br>&#x201c;Miss Elsa Maxwell has been a Special Service Contact of this office since September of 1942 but contact has been had with her infrequently. The Bureau is aware, of course, that presently she is writing a column for the <i>New York Post</i> and for some time now she has enjoyed the reputation of a successful hostess at gatherings which she arranges for socially prominent people. However, it has come to the attention of this office in the recent past that generally they consider her now to be a person of somewhat unsavory background and reputation. In addition, the Bureau itself has evidence of the fact that she is indiscreet and not entirely trustworthy, as is indicated in G-2 reports forwarded as enclosures to this office with a letter from the Bureau dated January 8, 1943. <br>&#x201c;For the reasons outlined above it is deemed advisable therefore to discontinue the services of Miss Maxwell as a Special Service Contact and this will be done unless the Bureau advises to the contrary.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Elsa&#x2019;s indictment of racism, from her column in the <i>New York Post</i>, November 16, 1943: <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s look this matter of prejudice straight in the eye. I&#x2019;m sick and tired of all the pussyfooting that&#x2019;s been going on about Jim Crow. Either we are believers in the principles of democracy&#x2014;as we piously declare, three times a day&#x2014;or we are a collection of the greatest frauds the world has seen. <br>&#x201c;For generations the conventional and learned citizens of this republic have stood stolidly silent while the American Negro has been vilified, libeled, and denied almost all access to the privileged places of sweetness and light.&#x2026; Democracy has been wayward in the cause of democracy.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Although as lively and perky as a sparrow, Miss Maxwell never strikes me as being a particularly happy woman herself. She has unsmiling eyes. She is restless. One of her idiosyncrasies is to eat chocolate continually between the courses of meals&#x2014;which is to me only less disconcerting than that abominable habit of smoking between the courses. <br>&#x2014;&#x201c;The Talk of London,&#x201d; a pseudonymous column by &#x201c;The Dragoman&#x201d; in the <i>Daily Express</i>, October 22, 1932 <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Headline in the <i>New York Herald-Tribune</i>, 1957: ELSA MAXWELL ORDERED TO PAY $840 TO FAROUK FOR INSULT, which, decoded, was reporting that a court in Paris had ordered Elsa to pay that amount to the deposed King of Egypt for defamation of character. While still on the throne, he had invited her to one of his parties. Elsa replied with a telegram to his equerry which read, &#x201c;I do not associate with clowns, monkeys, or corrupt gangsters.&#x201d; An intemperate reaction, surely, from the author of <i>Elsa Maxwell&#x2019;s Etiquette Book</i>, published around the time of the king&#x2019;s party. In it, Elsa wrote that &#x201c;whenever you are asked to be a guest you are paid a compliment. Your host or hostess, in effect, looks upon you as someone who will contribute to the success of their party. A prompt reply will express your appreciation of the invitation.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Elsa Maxwell took a bad fall on the Guinness yacht in Monte Carlo.

It was kind of you to remember me on this occasion, and I am most appreciative of your thoughtfulness. John F. Kennedy.&#x201d; <br>The following day, Western Union notified the White House that the telegram was undelivered because Miss Maxwell was on the high seas aboard the SS <i>France</i>. It was her final trip abroad. (The telegram was missent to the Park Sheraton Hotel, rather than the Delmonico, where Elsa lived at the time. Had the address been correct, she would have received the telegram before departure. The great irony is that both Elsa and President Kennedy celebrated their last birthdays in that month of May 1963. She died on Friday, November 1, exactly three weeks before the assassination.) <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>In 1969, the director of Ferncliff Cemetery and Mausoleum, in Hartsdale, New York, assured Mickey Deans, widower of Judy Garland, that &#x201c;your wife will be the star of Ferncliff.

Their adventure begins in Honiara, the capital city of the Solomon Islands, where Maria and Dag first encounter Pidgin English and men with mouths stained red from chewing betel nuts and lime. They snorkel incredible reefs alive with the rich blues, greens and reds of hundreds of fish, coral and clamshells -- and the odd lagoon shark! During their travels, they visit Skull Island, which houses the heads of dead chiefs; they learn to cook traditional food like taro and cassava roots; they witness the incredible, huge leatherback turtles burying their eggs in the sand and making decoy nest holes to fool the local monitor lizards. They even get lost among small, remote, uncharted islands. Yet everywhere Maria and Dag go, the locals welcome them with generosity and kindness. </p><p> Ever wonder about giant fruit bats, what a bathroom in the jungle looks like or what are the top ten uses for coconuts? Sidebars recount fascinating cultural facts and information from around the Islands. Maps are dispersed throughout the text with spectacular photography, enabling the reader to follow the kayak along its journey. An index is included for easy reference. </p></p><p><p> <b>Maria Coffey</b> and <b>Dag Goering</b> are a husband-and-wife team who have traveled the world together, Maria writing about their adventures and Dag photographing them.

Written in gentle, poetic prose full of compassion and insight, it encourages us to trust the processes of our own heart and mind as we make life&#x2019;s many decisions.</p><p>Margaret Silf is a well-known retreat leader and the author of several books, including &#34;Close to the Heart,&#34; &#34;The Gift of Prayer,&#34; and &#34;Inner Compass.&#34;Her spare prose a mute rebuke to the anecdotal loquaciousness of many self-help books on the spiritual life, Silf aims to help her readers craft thoughtful decisions in a world in which options seem endless and decisions pressing. Stringing her sentences out like scavenger hunt clues in a white landscape, the British author of <i>The Gift of Prayer</i>, <i>Wayfaring</i> and other explorations of spirituality divides her book into five sections on such topics as how to figure out which choices are truly necessary, how to choose with integrity and how to follow up on a decision once made. The slim book is peppered with practical advice, as when Silf advises her readers to avoid the "if-onlys" "what-ifs" and "might-have beens" that often get in the way of decision making. In a particularly helpful segment, Silf includes several discernment tests readers can use to predict the potential consequences of a decision. Some of her longtime fans may be frustrated by the format, lack of illustrations and dearth of overtly Christian content, but they will not be surprised by her commitment to decision making that is careful, forward looking and informed by a sense of responsibility to oneself and to the world. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It came to its real climax with the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868, the event which forms the centerpiece of this book. The Meiji Restoration &#x2014; as history calls it &#x2014; toppled the shogunate, and brought a seventeen-year-old boy emperor back from the secluded Imperial Palace in Kyoto to preside over what amounted to a political and cultural revolution. With this, Japan's extraordinary self-modernization began in earnest. Coming to power just as the Tokugawa regime was suffering the worst military defeat in its history, Yoshinobu strongly suspected that the rule of the Tokugawas &#x2014; the third and longest lived of Japan's three warrior governments - was swiftly becoming an anachronism. During a year of frenetic activity, he overhauled the military systems, reorganized the civil administration, promoted industrial development, and expanded foreign intercourse, with the farsighted aim of creating a unified Japan. Alarmed by these reforms, pro-imperial interests moved against him, precipitating the Boshin Civil War and the final defeat of the shogunal armies. To the surprise of his enemies, Yoshinobu capitulated. It was this surrender of authority at a crucial point that made the transfer of sovereignty relatively peaceful. He then retired to Mito and lived quietly for the rest of his life, studying the new art of photography. Ennobled a prince in the new European-style nobility of the Meiji era, he died in 1913.</p><p>The life story of Tokugawa Yoshinobu (1837-1913), the 15th and final successor to the powerful Tokugawa shogunate, is intrinsically interesting and well written to boot. Narrated by Japan's popular and prolific Ryotaro Shiba, and translated into a spare and engaging English text by Juliet Winters Carpenter, <i>The Last Shogun</i> is a mesmerizingly good read. With isolationist Japan coming under increasing foreign pressure to open its bolted doors and civil war threatening from within, Yoshinobu lived, schemed, and ruled during a time of great historic consequence. His rise to power is recounted with narrative flair, from his birth in the least prestigious of the three Tokugawa family branches, through his rigorous early training (his father made him sleep with a sword at either side of his head to ensure that he wouldn't toss and turn), and into his shogun years. From there, Shiba details the military crises of a dying regime and how Yoshinobu attempted to stem the assaults of a new era. With the behind-the-scenes machinations of intrigue, the progression of internal and external pressures, the political personalities of the times, and the rich cultural flavor of an insular Japan, the story is gripping enough for a long plane flight--yet it's more than just a way to pass the travel time. Reading Ryotaro Shiba's account of Yoshinobu's life provides a wonderful backdrop for a present-day visit to Japan, painting a scene that's drenched in the ambiance of Japanese traditions while offering an understanding of Japan's complex history in the form of a rich and compelling James Micheneresque narrative.<b>RYOTARO SHIBA</b> is one of Japan&#x2019;s bet-loved writers of all time. Working as a newspaper reporter, he began to write 1959 received the Naoki Prize for his novel The Owl Castle. His many works, which often present new interpretation of turbulent times such as the Meiji Restoration, have had enduring success with Japanese readers. He was named a member of the Japan Art Academy in 1981, cited as a person of cultural merit in 1991, and was conferred with Order of Culture in 1993. Shiba died in 1996.</p><h2>The Journal of Curious Letters (Book One of The 13th Reality Series)</h2><p>What if every time you made a choice that had a significant consequence, a new, alternate reality was created--the life that would&#39;ve been had you made the other choice?

These are just the basic ingredients in this adventure served up by Dashner in what is the start of a series that will capture the imagination of young and old alike. Atticus Higginbottom (Tick to all who know him) is smart, well-adjusted and something of a loner at school, preferring his family, the library and the Internet to his classmates. So he s surprised to receive a letter postmarked in Macadamia, Alaska, from someone he s never even heard of. But he s intrigued and makes a commitment to join with his correspondent to save many lives. Though there are chunks of text that are overwritten, the telling is generally laced with a strong sense of humor and a sure hand at plot; the author is plainly in tune with today s fan base.

Physician, researcher, and award-winning science writer, Siddhartha Mukherjee examines cancer with a cellular biologist's precision, a historian's perspective, and a biographer's passion. The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with--and perished from--for more than five thousand years. </p><p>The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance, but also of hubris, paternalism, and misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out "war against cancer." The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist. </p><p>From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave may have cut off her diseased breast, to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjee's own leukemia patient, Carla, "The Emperor of All Maladies "is about the people who have soldiered through fiercely demanding regimens in order to survive--and to increase our understanding of this iconic disease. </p><p>Riveting, urgent, and surprising, "The Emperor of All Maladies "provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments. It is an illuminating book that provides hope and clarity to those seeking to demystify cancer.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2010</strong>: "In 2010, about six hundred thousand Americans, and more than 7 million humans around the world, will die of cancer." With this sobering statistic, physician and researcher Siddhartha Mukherjee begins his comprehensive and eloquent "biography" of one of the most virulent diseases of our time. An exhaustive account of cancer's origins, <i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i> illustrates how modern treatments--multi-pronged chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, as well as preventative care--came into existence thanks to a century's worth of research, trials, and small, essential breakthroughs around the globe. While <i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i> is rich with the science and history behind the fight against cancer, it is also a meditation on illness, medical ethics, and the complex, intertwining lives of doctors and patients. Mukherjee's profound compassion--for cancer patients, their families, as well as the oncologists who, all too often, can offer little hope--makes this book a very human history of an elusive and complicated disease. <em>--Lynette Mong</em><br> <br>Siddhartha Mukherjee M.D., Ph.D., is a cancer physician and researcher.

For Isabel, the watershed was always eleven-thirty; that was the point at which if nothing was achieved, then nothing would be, the point at which one had to think about lunch, now just an hour away. <br>&nbsp;<br>Since Charlie had started going to his playgroup, the morn�ings had become even shorter, as he had to be fetched shortly after noon, and it took ten minutes to get him back and another ten minutes to get him changed out of his morning clothes; by this time, he would be covered in finger paint, crumbs, pieces of a curious modelling substance much approved of by the play�group authorities, grains of sand from the sandpit and, very occasionally, what looked like specks of blood. Boys, it seemed to Isabel, were magnets for dirt and detritus, and the only solu�tion, if one were wanted, was frequent changes of clothing. Or one could throw up one&#x2019;s hands and allow them to get dirtier through the day and then hose them down&#x2014;metaphorically, of course&#x2014;in the early evening. <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel opted to change Charlie, and so his morning clothes, once abandoned, were replaced with afternoon clothes. She decided that she rather liked the idea of having afternoon clothes, even if one were not a two-year-old. Changing into one&#x2019;s afternoon clothes could become something of a ritual, rather like changing for dinner&#x2014;which so few people did any more. And the afternoon clothes themselves could be the sub�ject of deliberation and chosen with care; they would be more loose-fitting than one&#x2019;s morning clothes, more autumnal in shade, perhaps&#x2014;clothes that would reflect the lengthening of shadows and sit well with the subtle change in light that comes after three; russet clothes, comfortable linen, loose-fitting col�lars and sleeves. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You thinking?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>It was Isabel&#x2019;s housekeeper, Grace. She had worked in the house when Isabel&#x2019;s father was still alive, and had been kept on by Isabel. It would have been impossible to ask Grace to leave&#x2014;even if Isabel had wanted to do so; she came with the house and had naturally assumed that the house could not be run without her. Isabel had felt vaguely apologetic about having a housekeeper&#x2014;it seemed such an extravagant, <i>privileged </i>thing to do, but a discussion with her friend, Peter Stevenson, had helped. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What good would it do if you were to stop that particular item of expenditure?&#x201d; Peter said. &#x201c;All it would mean was that Grace would be out of a job. What would it achieve?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But I feel embarrassed,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;Somebody of my age doesn&#x2019;t need a housekeeper. People will think I&#x2019;m lazy.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Peter was too perceptive to swallow that. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not it, is it? What&#x2019;s worrying you is that people will think that you&#x2019;re well-off, which you are. So why not just accept it? You use your money generously&#x2014;I know that. Carry on like that and forget what you imagine people think about you. It&#x2019;s not an actual <i>sin </i>to have money. The sin exists in using it selfishly, which you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh well,&#x201d; said Isabel. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Now Grace stood in the doorway of Isabel&#x2019;s workroom, a bucket in hand, on her way to performing the daily chore of washing down the Victorian encaustic-tile floor in the entrance hall. Isabel was not sure that this floor had to be washed every day, but Grace had always done it and would have resisted any suggestion that she change her routine. <br>&nbsp;<br>Now Grace&#x2019;s question hung in the air. She often asked Isabel whether she was thinking; it was almost an accusation. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I suppose I am thinking. But not about work, I must admit.&#x201d; Isabel, who was seated at her desk, gave a despairing glance at the piles of paper before her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid that I&#x2019;ve accomplished very little this morning.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; said Grace. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve done none of the ironing yet, I&#x2019;m afraid. All those shirts of Jamie&#x2019;s.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Leave them,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;Jamie can iron them himself. It&#x2019;s very therapeutic for men to iron. Therapeutic for women, that is.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Grace shook her head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do them later this afternoon.&#x201d; She put down the bucket. &#x201c;Where does the time go? Do you ever ask yourself that?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Constantly,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;As most people do.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;Mind you, how much of our time, do you think, is spent asking ourselves where the time goes?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel remembered that it was a Friday, which meant that Grace would have spent the previous evening at one of her spiritualist meetings. She enjoyed hearing about these, as Grace was always prepared to give a candid assessment of the visiting medium. The previous week the visiting medium had been from Glasgow and had made contact with spirits who voiced an inter�esting, if somewhat unusual, complaint. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He said that there were a number of spirits trying to get through. He said that that they were all from Glasgow.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel had raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Do spirits live in particular places? I thought that the whole point about being disembodied is that you rose above constraints of place. Have I got it wrong?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Grace shook her head. &#x201c;Spirits often hang about the places that were special to them before they crossed over,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He said that these spirits wanted to get back to Glasgow because they weren&#x2019;t happy in Edinburgh.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A likely story!&#x201d; snorted Isabel. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;My feelings too,&#x201d; Grace had replied. <br>&nbsp;<br>Now, Isabel asked about the previous evening. Was the medium any good, or at least better than the man who con�tacted the unhappy Glaswegian spirits? <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Much better,&#x201d; said Grace. &#x201c;He was one of our regulars. We had him about four months ago and he was really good. He saw somebody&#x2019;s husband&#x2014;clear as day, he said. I was sitting next to the woman and I comforted her. It was very moving.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel said nothing. The fundamental premises of Grace&#x2019;s spiritualist meetings might not have withstood rigorous, rational examination, but there was little doubt in her mind about the solace that they gave. And what was wrong with anything that gave comfort to lives bereft of it? <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Grace continued. &#x201c;This medium&#x2014;he&#x2019;s called Mr. Barr; I don&#x2019;t know his first name, I&#x2019;m afraid&#x2014;he works in a bank. In the back room, I think; he&#x2019;s not a teller or anything like that. Anyway, he has a real talent for getting through to the other side. You can see it in his eyes; he just has that look to him&#x2014;you know what I mean?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel did. &#x201c;The light&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; said Grace. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the light that shines from the eyes. There&#x2019;s no mistaking it and he had it. It was like .&nbsp; . .&#x201d; She searched for an analogy, and then decided, &#x201c;Like a lighthouse.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel struggled with the image. Lighthouse eyes would pre�sumably send forth beams at intervals, which would create a rather odd impression, she felt, especially at night, and if such people lived by the sea . . . <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He said something very interesting,&#x201d; Grace continued. &#x201c;He said that he was getting a strong message from somebody who had been a stockbroker in Edinburgh in his lifetime. He was now on the other shore and wanted us to know that everything would be all right.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s reassuring,&#x201d; said Isabel. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I think he was talking about the country&#x2019;s economy. He said that we shouldn&#x2019;t worry&#x2014;it was going to be all right.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;I wonder how he knows?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Grace assumed a rather superior expression. &#x201c;They know,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We may not understand how they know, but the important thing is that they know. It&#x2019;s to do with time. Time has a different meaning in the spirit world.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel did not contradict this; she knew there was little point. If asked to justify her claims about the world beyond, Grace tended to shelter behind the idea that there were some forms of knowledge that somebody like Isabel simply could not grasp. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Skepticism closes the mind,&#x201d; she would say. &#x201c;Like a trap.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Grace continued with her report. &#x201c;He became quite specific, you know. He mentioned a particular company that he said would do well. He said that all the conditions were right for this to happen.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel expressed her surprise. &#x201c;A tip? An investment tip?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Grace. &#x201c;It was not like that at all. The spirit was just sharing something with us. He was obviously happy that this company would do well and he wanted us to share his happiness.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel hesitated for a moment. Grace&#x2019;s meeting must have been rich in comic possibilities, with the medium issuing what amounted to a stock-market prediction, and some of those attending, perhaps, discreetly writing down the details. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What company?&#x201d; she asked on impulse. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;West of Scotland Turbines,&#x201d; said Grace. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see their shares in the paper. Look at the stock-market page.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So they exist?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, of course they exist. I looked them up. They make tur�bines for hydroelectric schemes.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Grace appeared to feel that they had spent long enough on turbines and went on to say something about needing new scouring liquid for the upstairs shower, which was becoming mildewed. She looked at Isabel slightly reproachfully, as if she were responsible for the mildew. Isabel thought: It&#x2019;s not my fault, but Grace will always blame me. <br>&nbsp;<br>Then Grace said, &#x201c;Oh, somebody phoned while you were out. I asked for her name, but she just left a number for you to call back. It&#x2019;s in the basket. Some people don&#x2019;t give their names, which is odd, I think. It&#x2019;s as if they&#x2019;ve got something to hide .&nbsp; . .&#x201d; She examined Isabel as if she were conniving in, or at least con�doning, a whole series of anonymous calls. Then she continued, &#x201c;She sounded Australian.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>It was the woman whom Cat had met. Isabel glanced at her watch: there was time to return the call before she went off to collect Charlie. That would mean, of course, that she would have done no work at all that morning, and would probably do very little that afternoon. Did it matter? Would the world be changed if the next edition of the <i>Review of Applied Ethics </i>did not come out on time? The answer, of course, was that it would make very little difference&#x2014;a humbling thought. <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel rose from her desk and made her way into the kitchen. If Grace wanted to leave her a note, there was a small basket on top of the fridge in which notes were placed. There was one now, with a number scribbled on it in pencil. Under�neath the number, Grace had written: <i>woman</i>. Isabel smiled; she was reminded of her father, who had once said to her, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t write&#x2014;or say&#x2014;any more than you have to. Just don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Or think, perhaps? <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel took the note back to her study. There she wrote on it <i>West of Scotland Turbines</i>, and then picked up the telephone.</p></p><h2>Great Shipwrecks of the Pacific Coast</h2><p>Fascinating, never-before-documented stories of the worst shipwrecks on the Pacific Coast during the golden age of coastal transportation, 1854 to 1929<br> <br> In this intriguing chronicle, author Robert Belyk closely examines ten significant maritime disasters that occurred during one of the most turbulent eras in the history of travel. Discover the real-life drama endured by those caught in the terrifying midst of disaster at sea and the real causes behind the tragedies. Vividly re-created and painstakingly researched, the shipwrecks accounted for here include:<br> * 1854: the Yankee Blade runs aground off Point Arguello, California.Twenty-eight passengers lose their lives.<br> * 1875: The old side-wheeler Pacific rams another passenger ship off the coast of Cape Flattery, Washington. Two hundred and seventy-seven people perish when her rotting hull gives way.<br> * 1906: The Valencia strikes a reef off the Washington coastline. Before dozens of dazed onlookers on the shore, the ship goes down, taking 117 passengers and crew with her.</p><p>The eighty years spanning the California gold rush to the start of the Great Depression saw thousands of passengers and crews perish in Pacific steamship wrecks. Yet despite the alarming number of incidents during this period, few have asked just why so many ships were lost. In Great Shipwrecks of the Pacific Coast, author Robert Belyk looks beyond commonly provided&#x2014;&#x2014;and frequently superficial&#x2014;&#x2014;public explanations of weather conditions or human error, and closely examines ten significant maritime disasters that occurred along the Pacific coastline from California to Alaska. <p>Filled with the drama of life and death aboard doomed ships, Belyk brings to life the struggles of real people caught in desperate situations when disaster strikes at sea. In 1865, only 19 of the 204 passengers and crew on board survived the wreck of the Brother Jonathan, whose owners had been more concerned with maximum profitability than with the safety of their passengers. When, in 1907, the Columbia disappeared under the ocean surface in just eight minutes after ramming another passenger ship, her poorly maintained iron hull simply gave out, leading to the deaths of 87 passengers. And in 1918, all 353 of the ship&#x2019;s passengers and crew drowned when the Princess Sophia, a victim of bad navigation, bad weather, and bad judgment, struck a reef and sank. As these tales of disaster at sea unravel, never-before-told details reveal how those involved&#x2014;&#x2014;heroes as well as cowards&#x2014;&#x2014;reacted under such terrifying circumstances. Along with information drawn from contemporary sources and documented reports, these accounts lay bare the causes behind the tragedies, from carelessness and ill-equipped, unseaworthy ships to politics, personal greed, and pride.</p> <p>Both intriguing reading and invaluable historical record, this chronicle of a tumultuous era illustrates the ironic fate encountered by those who believed they would exchange the hardships of overland travel for the relative safety and comfort of an ocean voyage.</p>ROBERT C.

On the way, John Moschos and his pupil Sophronius the Sophist stayed in caves, monasteries, and remote hermitages, collecting the wisdom of the stylites and the desert fathers before their fragile world finally shattered under the great eruption of Islam. More than a thousand years later, using Moschos's writings as his guide, William Dalrymple sets off to retrace their footsteps.<br><br>Dalrymple's pilgrimage takes him through a bloody civil war in eastern Turkey, the ruins of Beirut, the vicious tensions of the West Bank, and a fundamentalist uprising in southern Egypt, and it becomes an elegy to the slowly dying civilization of Eastern Christianity and to the peoples that have kept its flame alive. From the Holy Mountain is a rich and gripping bl of history and spirituality, adventure and politics, threaded through with Dalrymple's unique sense of black comedy.<br></p><p>William Dalrymple is the award-winning author of the British best-sellers In Xanadu and The City of Djinns. He divides his time between London, Edinburgh, and Delhi.<br>A memorable historical journey through the twilight of Eastern Christianity in the Middle East, heartfelt and beautifully told. Dalrymple (The City of Djinns: A Year in Delhi, 1994) has carved an unorthodox niche for an English travel writer: He is following in the 1,400-year-old path of an Orthodox monk. In 587, Friar John Moschos and a young student trekked across the Middle East, collecting precious relics and manuscripts from obscure monasteries, from present-day Turkey to Egypt. Dalrymples quest is similar; he is preserving the stories of the last generation of Orthodox Christians in the Middle East. Retracing Moschoss steps, Dalrymple finds once glorious Christian communities on the brink of extinction. One Turkish village that had 17 Syrian Orthodox churches now has only one [Christian] inhabitant, its elderly priest. In Turkey, Armenian Christianity has been more systematically erased, with cathedrals renovated into mosques, gravestones obliterated, and any mention of the Armenian presence in Turkey censored from publications, turning their existence into a historical myth. In one town, Dalrymple interviews a superannuated survivor of the Syrian Christian resistance of 1915, when Syrians witnessed the genocide of the Armenians and knew that they were next to be deported. Today, however, the descendants of Orthodox Christians in Turkey and elsewhere are emigrating as quickly as they can. Old churches stand abandoned or are employed for other purposesin Istanbul, for example, Dalrymple is denied entrance to a famous basilica because there is a Turkish beauty contest going on inside. Dalrymple is a talented writer, with a subtle wit, a keen eye for historical irony, and a relish for architectural detail. If his treatment of Eastern Orthodoxy is somewhat romantic, ignoring centuries of internecine conflict among various ethnic groups, it is understandable given his urgency to record the plight of this last generation of Orthodox practitioners in Muslim-dominated areas. An evensong for a dying civilization. (24 b&amp;w and 8 color photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Named the &#34;World&#39;s Greatest Bartender&#34; by Forbes in 1998 and 2001, Field lives in Paris, France.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>The Bar Hemingway is probably one of the most important bars in the world today. <i>Forbes Digital Tool</i> Internet magazine cited it as 'The World's Greatest Bar, 1998' and its Head Bartender as 'The World's Greatest Bartender'. The author was to be cited in 2001 again by <i>Forbes</i> as the Greatest Bartender in the World. In 1983 I had obtained the title of No.2 in the world (Martini Grand Prix World Cocktail Competition) for my knowledge in cocktails and alcohols, and had coveted the premier position ever since. <i>Le Figaro</i> newspaper cited the Head Bartender as one of the 20 most creative people in France, comparing him with architects, dancers, chefs and writers. The <i>Times</i> called the Bar Hemingway the best kept secret in Paris, and compliments for our service have been bestowed upon us from all over the world. In 2001 <i>Le Figaro</i> stated that the Hemingway produced the best Dry Martini there is.<br><br>The story of the Bar Hemingway begins in 1921, when it was decided to create a room for alcoholic refreshment in the Cambon Wing. Le Caf� Parisien was designed in the art deco style of the period by Picot. The Head Bartender was to be Frank Meier, and he would receive the world's elite: Sir Winston Churchill, President Theodore Roosevelt, No�l Coward, Scott Fitzgerald and Cole Porter, to name but a few. It was at this time, incidentally, that Frank Meier invented the Royal Highball (a marvellously refreshing drink made with cognac, strawberries and champagne) for the King of Spain.<br><br>Just opposite the bar was a very small 'salon de correspondance' with lovely wooden walls. This became the ladies' waiting room, where ladies waiting for their husbands would while away the 'minutes'. (Ladies, at this time, were not allowed in the bars.) In 1936 the principal bar was transformed to receive both sexes, and at the same time a second bar was created. This was 'Le Petit Bar', over which Bernard 'Bertin' Azimont was to preside until his retirement in 1975. The little bar was to become Ernest Hemingway's favourite haunt. He had discovered the Ritz Paris in 1925 after meeting Scott Fitzgerald in the 'Dixies Bar', a drinking hole for ex-patriot American artists and writers. The Dixies no longer exists, but Le Petit Bar, now known as the Bar Hemingway, continues to thrive. Hemingway adopted the bar as his Head Quarters and spent many hours there planning his strategies for the horse races at Auteuil. He would even, according to A.E. Hotchner's book <i>Papa Hemingway</i>, pick up the bets of Frank, George, Bertin and the other bartenders for the day's races. This was done under the profound inspiration of Bertin's Bloody Marys.<br><br>Ernest Hemingway, with his friend Colonel David Bruce (later to become the ambassador of the United States), were the first Americans to be served in the bar after the war. After hailing Sylvia Beach at Shakespeare and Co., the writer made a B-line for the cellars of the Ritz Paris. He was greeted and brought into the room now known as the Bar Hemingway (named after a suggestion from the bartender, Claude Decobert, who had served Hemingway on several occasions), where he downed 51 Dry Martinis. Incidentally, I often served Mr. Curley, in the line of American Ambassadors to have known Hemingway, at the Restaurant Au Petit Riche in 1989, but was never able to win him over to the benefits of cocktail drinking. Perhaps he too had the haunting memory of all those Martinis with Hemingway!<br><br>In 1962, Charles Ritz decided to create a third bar on the Vend�me side of the Hotel. Named The Lounge Bar, this serves an enormous daytime clientele and excels in afternoon tea and scones.<br><br>pardThe focus on the Vend�me Bar and the absence of Bertin in the late 1970s led the Petit Bar to meander like the rivers that Ernest Hemingway had once fished upon. Its activity eventually came to a halt in the middle of the 1980s and it was used for special parties only.<br><br>With the support of Jack Hemingway, who was very favorable to its project, the Ritz Paris pushed very hard for its re-opening, and in 1994 finally offered me the opportunity to become the bartender that I had always wanted to be. (My first letter asking for a position at the Ritz Paris had been in 1979!) The Ritz Paris and I worked extremely hard to create 'The Event', the opening of the Bar Hemingway, which happily coincided with the 50 years of peace since Hemingway had liberated the bars of the Ritz Paris.<br><br>We did it! I can honestly say that I never doubted that the Bar Hemingway would be a success. In fact, in 1998 it was decided to make the bar bigger to cope with the incredible volume of new visitors. Better still (and this has to be the greatest compliment a management can offer the Head Bartender), the Ritz Paris and its entire team let me and my Number Two, Johann Burgos, design the new room. (I even found the old espadon or swordfish in the Charles Ritz Grill Room. It was no longer in use and few people ever saw it. I took it down and hung it in the Bar Hemingway.) I was pretty jolly pleased with my latest acquisition until one day, upon arrival at the Ritz Paris, I found that my (well, I <i>had</i> caught it!) espadon was now hanging upon the Espadon Restaurant, high above the door on the Vend�me side. I felt a little like Ernest Hemingway might have done had he ever experienced 'the fish that got away'!<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Editions du Ch�ne</p><h2>The Loom</h2><p>Lydia knew her fate.

Kennedy was the first conspiracy theorist about his brother&#39;s murder. In this new account of the Kennedy years, David Talbot explains why - even on 22 November 1963 - RFK had reason to believe that dark forces were at work in Dallas.</p><p>David Talbot, author of the New York Times bestseller Brothers: The Hidden History of the Kennedy Years, is the founder and CEO of Salon. He lives in San Francisco.<b><p> 1 </p></b><p><b> NOVEMBER 22, 1963 </b> </p><p> Like all Americans who lived through that day, Robert F. Kennedy never forgot how he heard his brother had been shot. The attorney general, who had just turned thirty- eight, was eating lunch -- clam chowder and tuna sandwiches -- with United States Attorney Robert Morgenthau and his assistant by the pool at Hickory Hill, his Civil War-era mansion in McLean, Virginia, outside the capital. It was a perfect fall day -- the kind of bright, crisp Friday afternoon that makes a weekend seem full of promise -- and the grounds of the rolling green estate were afl ame with gold and red leaves from the shedding hickories, maples, and oaks that stood sentry over the property. Kennedy had just emerged from a mid- day swim, and as he talked and ate with the visiting lawmen, his trunks were still dripping. </p><p> Around 1:45 p.m., the phone extension at the other end of the pool rang. Kennedy's wife, Ethel, picked it up -- she held the receiver out to him. J. Edgar Hoover was calling. Bobby knew immediately something unusual had happened. The FBI director never phoned him at home. The two men regarded each other with a taut wariness that they both knew would only be broken when one of them left office. Each represented to the other what was wrong about America. "I have news for you," Hoover said. "The president's been shot." Hoover's voice was blunt and matter of fact. Kennedy would always remember not just the FBI chief 's words, but his chilling tone. </p><p> "History cracked open" for America on November 22, 1963, as playwright Tony Kushner observed years later. But the abyss that opened for Bobby Kennedy at that moment was the deepest of all. And it was Hoover, of all people, who brought him news of the apocalypse. "I think he told me with pleasure," Kennedy would recall. </p><p> Twenty minutes later, Hoover phoned again to deliver the final blow: "The president's dead," he said and promptly hung up. Again, Kennedy would remember, his voice was oddly flat -- "not quite as excited as if he were reporting the fact that he had found a Communist on the faculty of Howard University." </p><p> Hoover's curt phone calls confirmed that the "perfect communion" between the two brothers, as the <i>New York Times</i>' Anthony Lewis described the bond between President John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy -- a fraternal relationship unprecedented in presidential history -- was over. But they also clearly conveyed that Bobby had suffered a death of a different kind. His own power as attorney general instantly started to fade, already to a point where the director of the FBI no longer felt compelled to show deference, or even common human grace, to his superior in the Justice Department. </p><p> For the rest of the day and night, Bobby Kennedy would wrestle with his howling grief -- crying, or fighting against crying since that was the Kennedy way -- while using whatever power was still left him, before the new administration settled firmly into place, to figure out what had really happened in Dallas. He worked the phones at Hickory Hill; he met with a succession of people while waiting for Air Force One to return with the body of his brother, his brother's widow, and the new president; he accompanied his brother's remains to the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital; and he stayed coiled and awake in the White House until early the next morning. Lit up with the clarity of shock, the electricity of adrenaline, he constructed the outlines of the crime. </p><p> From his phone calls and conversations that day -- and into the following week -- it's possible to trace the paths that Robert Kennedy pursued as he tried to unveil the mystery. "With that amazing computer brain of his, he put it all together on the afternoon of November 22," his friend, journalist Jack Newfi eld, remarked. </p><p> RFK's search for the truth about the crime of the century has long been an untold story. But it is deeply loaded with historic significance. Kennedy's investigative odyssey -- which began with a frantic zeal immediately after his brother's assassination, and then secretly continued in fitful bursts until his own murder less than five years later -- did not succeed in bringing the case to court. But Robert Kennedy was a central figure in the drama -- not only as his brother's attorney general and the second most powerful official in the Kennedy administration, but as JFK's principal emissary to the dark side of American power. And his hunt for the truth sheds a cold, bright light on the forces that he suspected were behind the murder of his brother. Bobby Kennedy was America's fi rst assassination conspiracy theorist. </p><p> Predictably, the first phone call that Bobby made on November 22 after his initial conversation with Hoover was to Kenny O'Donnell. JFK's chief of staff had accompanied the president to Dallas and was with him at Parkland Memorial Hospital when he was pronounced dead at 2:00 p.m. Tough, taciturn, Boston Irish, O'Donnell was second only to Bobby himself in his political guardianship of the president. A close friend since they roomed together at Harvard and played on the college football team, O'Donnell was the man Bobby would have wanted at the scene of a crisis if he couldn't be there himself. As a B-17 bombardier, he had fl own thirty missions against Nazi Germany, was shot down and then escaped from enemy prison. In his final, legendary game as quarterback at Harvard, he ran for the winning touchdown against archrival Yale on a broken leg. </p><p> Bobby ran upstairs to phone O'Donnell from his bedroom, while Morgenthau and his assistant were led to a TV set in the drawing room at Hickory Hill. Not finding O'Donnell at the hospital, Kennedy spoke instead to Secret Service agent Clint Hill, the only offi cer who had performed heroically on the president's behalf that afternoon. Images of Hill rushing to leap onto the back of JFK's moving limousine would forever become part of the iconography of that eerie day. </p><p> It's not known precisely what Bobby learned that afternoon from the Secret Service man. But there was a darkness that immediately began growing in Hill and O'Donnell about what they'd seen and heard in Dallas. Neither man would ever be the same after November 22. </p><p> O'Donnell was riding immediately behind Kennedy's limousine in the Dallas motorcade, just ten feet away, along with fellow Boston Irishman Dave Powers, the White House aide and court jester. They were front row witnesses to the assassination. Powers would later say it felt as if they were "riding into an ambush." O'Donnell and more than one Secret Service man would tell Bobby the same thing that day: They were caught in a crossfire. It was a conspiracy. </p><p> Bobby Kennedy came to the same conclusion that afternoon. It was not a "he" who had killed his brother -- it was a "they." This is how he put it to his friend, Justice Department press spokesman Edwin Guthman. The former Pulitzer Prize-winning Seattle Times reporter had become close friends with Kennedy during the 1950s when they both put themselves on the line to investigate corruption and thuggery in the Teamsters' union. Guthman was one of Bobby's "band of brothers," as the attorney general years later inscribed a picture of his young, idealistic Justice Department team. The battle cry from Shakespeare's <i>Henry V</i> appealed to Bobby's sense of heroic mission: "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers / For he to-day that sheds his blood with me / Shall be my brother.../ And gentlemen...now a- bed / Shall think themselves accursed they were not here." If the perfect communion between Jack and Bobby was at the heart of the Kennedy administration, it was this wider circle of brothers -- all intensely devoted to the Kennedy cause -- who gave the New Frontier its blood and muscle. Bobby would quietly turn to several of these trusted aides to help him on his quest for the truth. </p><p> Guthman was having lunch with a congressman from Seattle on Capitol Hill when someone came rushing in to tell them the president had been shot. He immediately drove to Hickory Hill, where he spent the rest of the afternoon with Bobby. By now, Kennedy family members were gathering at the Virginia estate. But Bobby was also surrounding himself with "brothers" like Guthman. The two men paced endlessly together, back and forth on the backyard lawn. "There's so much bitterness I thought they would get one of us, but Jack, after all he'd been through, never worried about it," Kennedy told Guthman. </p><p> "Bob said, 'I thought they would get me, instead of the president,' " Guthman said, recalling the conversation years later. "He distinctly said 'they.'" </p><p> Guthman and others around Bobby that day thought "they" might be coming for the younger Kennedy next. So apparently did Bobby. He was normally opposed to tight security measures, which he found intrusive and perhaps even a sign of cowardice -- "Kennedys don't need bodyguards," he had said, even after he began receiving death threats as the crime-busting attorney general. But that afternoon, Kennedy allowed the Fairfax County police, who rushed to Hickory Hill after the assassination without being summoned, to protect his home. Later, the police were replaced by federal marshals, who encircled Kennedy's estate after Guthman and other RFK aides spoke to Chief U.S. Marshal Jim McShane. </p><p> Bobby trusted McShane and his men. James Joseph Patrick McShane was a street-tough Irish New York cop. He had worked with Bobby as an investigator for the Senate Rackets Committee in the late 1950s and had served as bodyguard for JFK during the presidential campaign. He and his men had put their lives on the line in the civil rights battles of the South, saving Martin Luther King Jr. from a howling mob that had surrounded a church in Montgomery, Alabama, where he was preaching in May 1961. The following year, McShane and his ragtag troops had again formed a thin, bloodied line in defense of James Meredith, the black student who set off a fiery white uprising when he enrolled at the University of Mississippi. McShane was "built like a tank, had the crushed nose of the Golden Glov...</p></p><h2>Great Cloud of Witnesses in Hebrews Eleven</h2><p>A classic exposition that includes an examination of the great heroes of the faith.

By the time he was five years old, he had been transferred to several different families. Eventually he came to live with the Picketts, an older couple with grown children of their own. </p><p> During his stay with the Picketts, which lasted until he was 17 years old, Antwone suffered near&#x2013;constant verbal and physical abuse at the hands of &#x329;zz Pickett, and sexual abuse from a neighbour. The damage to his self&#x2013;esteem was tremendous, yet Antwone managed to resist the gang&#x2013;like behaviour and drug use that so many of his friends were engaged in. Finally he fled and before long he was living on the streets, homeless. Again rescuing himself, he enlisted in the Navy, where he created a &#x961;mily' for himself and with the help of a Navy psychologist worked through his past. After he left the Navy, while working as a security guard at Sony Pictures in Hollywood, he told his story to one of the executives there, who encouraged him to write his life as a screenplay. </p><p> </p></p><p>Thank goodness Antwone Fisher's story has a happy ending--otherwise, his searing memoir would be nearly unbearable to read. His father was killed by a gunshot blast shortly before he was born in 1959; his 17-year-old mother gave him up for foster care. Unfortunately for Antwone, his foster mother was as successful at browbeating and demeaning her many wards as she was at lying to the Child Welfare authorities. His working-class African American neighborhood in Cleveland became purgatory for a sensitive, intelligent boy who quickly turned into a withdrawn underperformer at school. In Fisher's blow-by-blow account of his childhood, his sexual abuse at the hands of a female neighbor is hardly more horrifying than his foster mother's relentless cruelty--especially because respectable, churchgoing Mrs. Pickett justifies it all as due to the boy's wicked faults. Readers will be relieved when she dumps 15-year-old Antwone back at the Child Welfare office, even though he will endure homelessness and a scary spell of criminal employment, before an 11-year stint in the Navy provides him with a way forward. Grim though his tale is, Fisher displays throughout it the grit and stubborn integrity that kept him sane. He musters up some understanding (not forgiveness) for the dreadful Mrs. Pickett, and his eventual meeting with his burned-out mother is painfully poignant. He certainly deserves the beautiful wife and cute two-year-old daughter, cooking pancakes for him in the book's closing and redemptive scene. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Antwone Fisher is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Finding Fish.</em> He is also the screenwriter of the film <em>Antwone Fisher,</em> based on his life and directed by Academy Award winner Denzel Washington.

The quality of Tom Hollander's performance, however, renders such help unnecessary. Hollander's vocal suggestiveness, grasp of tone, and overall emotional resonance with the novel give listeners amazing clarity (especially if, like this reviewer, they've previously read the book relying on the glossary). You listen to Alex's adventures, amazed at the clarity Hollander gives to such a verbally ambitious work.

It was making a lot of noise, and when she looked, smoke was billowing all around it. She stepped to the side of the road as the pale yellow car slowly sputtered and clunked past her. It looked like a pretty car. Too bad it didn't work right.<br>When Lucy got to town, she noticed the pale yellow car parked in front of Hempley's Garage, and a man in a brown suit was talking to Mr. Hempley. But it was the lady getting out of the car who really captured Lucy's attention. Wrapped in a royal blue coat with a big silver fur collar, she had shining hair almost the same color as the pale yellow car and cut short with bangs that curled like a fringe around her pretty face.<br>As Lucy got closer, she could see the lady's rosy cheeks and lips of scarlet red. She looked just like a real movie star! <br>"Hello, doll." The lady smiled down at Lucy.<br>"Hello," Lucy managed to say back to her.<br>"Is there a place I can buy a soda around here?"

Both are at the mercy of their unrelenting wants and needs, and both are unaware that the path they are on is careening toward murder. Much is at stake, including the affluent life they lead in their beautiful waterfront condo in Chicago, as she, the killer, and he, the victim, rush haplessly toward the main event, oblivious of the destiny they are jointly creating, caught in the thrall of disaster unfolding. <p>Chapter by chapter, the narrative evolves from their alternating perspectives. He is a committed cheater. She lives and breathes denial. He exists in dual worlds. She likes to settle scores. He decides to play for keeps. She has nothing left to lose. The alternating voices pitch the reader back and forth between protagonists in conflict who are fighting for self-preservation, both of them making deeply consequential mistakes, behaving in ever more foolhardy ways, losing at the games they&#x2019;re playing.</p> <p></p> <p> <i>The Silent Wife </i>is a finely wrought, emotionally charged psychological thriller about a marriage in the throes of dissolution, a couple headed for catastrophe, concessions that can&#x2019;t be made, and promises that won&#x2019;t be kept.

Harrison </b>is the author of four non-fiction books. The Silent Wife is her debut novel and she was at work on a new psychological thriller when she died in 2013. Harrison was married to the visual artist John Massey and lived in Toronto.<p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p>HER</p><p>It&#x2019;s early September. Jodi Brett is in her kitchen, making dinner. Thanks to the open plan of the condo, she has an unobstructed view through the living room to its east-facing windows and beyond to a vista of lake and sky, cast by the evening light in a uniform blue. A thinly drawn line of a darker hue, the horizon, appears very near at hand, almost touchable. She likes this delineating arc, the feeling it gives her of being encircled. The sense of containment is what she loves most about living here, in her aerie on the twenty-seventh ?oor.</p><p>At forty-?ve, Jodi still sees herself as a young woman. She does not have her eye on the future but lives very much in the moment, keeping her focus on the everyday. She assumes, without having thought about it, that things will go on inde?nitely in their imperfect yet entirely acceptable way. In other words, she is deeply unaware that her life is now peaking, that her youthful resilience&#x2014;which her twenty-year marriage to Todd Gilbert has been slowly eroding&#x2014;is approaching a ?nal stage of disintegration, that her notions about who she is and how she ought to conduct herself are far less stable than she supposes, given that a few short months are all it will take to make a killer out of her.</p><p>If you told her this she would not believe you. Murder is barely a word in her vocabulary, a concept without meaning, the subject of stories in the news having to do with people she doesn&#x2019;t know and will never meet. Domestic violence she ?nds especially implausible, that everyday friction in a family setting could escalate to such a degree. There are reasons for this incomprehension, even aside from her own habit of self-control: She is no idealist, believes in taking the bad with the good, does not pick ?ghts, and is not easily baited.</p><p>The dog, a golden retriever with a silky blond coat, sits at her feet as she works at the cutting board. Every now and then she throws him a slice of raw carrot, which he catches in his mouth and joyfully grinds up with his molars. This vegetable toss is a long-standing predinner ritual, one that she and the dog have enjoyed from the time she brought him home as a roly-poly pup to take Todd&#x2019;s mind o? his yearning for progeny, which sprang up, seemingly overnight, around the time he turned forty. She named the dog Freud in anticipation of the fun she could poke at his namesake, the misogynist whom she was forced to take seriously at university. Freud passing gas, Freud</p><p>eating garbage, Freud chasing his tail. The dog is endlessly good-natured and doesn&#x2019;t mind in the least being an object of fun.</p><p>Trimming vegetables and chopping herbs, she throws herself bodily into the work. She likes the intensity of cooking&#x2014;the readiness of the gas ?ame, the timer marking o? the minutes, the immediacy of the result. She&#x2019;s aware of the silence beyond the kitchen, everything rushing to the point in time when she&#x2019;ll hear his key in the lock, an event that she anticipates with pleasure. She can still feel that making dinner for Todd is an occasion, can still marvel at the stroke of fate that brought him into her life, a matter of rank chance that did not seem to favor a further acquaintance, much less a future of appetizing meals, lovingly prepared.</p><p>It came to pass on a rainy morning in spring. Busy with her graduate studies in psychology, waiting tables at night, overworked, exhausted, she was moving house, driving north on State Street in a rental van loaded with her household goods. As she prepared to change lanes from right to left she might have looked over her shoulder or maybe not. She found the van awkward, didn&#x2019;t have a feel for it, and on top of this her windows were fogged and she&#x2019;d missed her turn at the last set of lights. Given these conditions she might have been distracted&#x2014;a question that later came to be much discussed between them. When he clipped her driver&#x2019;s-side door and spun her into oncoming tra?c, there was a general honking of horns and squealing of brakes, and before she could pull herself together&#x2014;before she fully realized that her van had come to a standstill and she was perfectly alright&#x2014;he was screaming at her through her closed window.</p><p>&#x201c;You crazy bitch. What in God&#x2019;s name do you think you&#x2019;re doing? Are you some kind of maniac? Where did you learn to drive? People like you should stay o? the road. Are you going to get out of your car or are you just going to sit there like an imbecile?&#x201d;</p><p>His tirade that day in the rain did not give a favorable impression, but a man who&#x2019;s been in a car crash is going to be irate even if it&#x2019;s his own fault, which in this instance it was not, so when he called a few days later to ask her to dinner, she graciously accepted.</p><p>He took her to Greektown, where they ate lamb souvlaki washed down with cold retsina. The restaurant was crowded, the tables close together, the lights bright. They found themselves shouting over the din and laughing at their failure to be heard. What conversation they could manage was pared down to succinct phrases like, &#x201c;The food is good . . . I like it here . . . my windows were fogged . . . if it hadn&#x2019;t happened I would never have met you.&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t go out on many bona ?de dates. The men she knew from university took her for pizza and beer and counted out their money. They&#x2019;d meet her at the restaurant scru?y and unshaven, still in the clothes they&#x2019;d worn to class. Whereas Todd had put on a clean shirt, and he&#x2019;d picked her up, and they&#x2019;d driven to the restaurant together&#x2014;and now he was looking after her, re?lling her glass and checking on her comfort level. Sitting across from him, she was pleased with what she saw&#x2014;the way he casually took up space and his air of being in charge. She liked the homey habit he had of wiping his knife on his bread and that he put down his credit card without looking at the bill.</p></p><h2>Batman: Under the Hood - VOL 02</h2><p>Batman confronts various foes while the Red Hood tears apart Gotham&#39;s underworld and plans revenge on the man who killed him.</p><p>Judd Winick is one of comics&#39; rapidly-ascending stars, having written for such titles as Detective Comics, Exiles, Green Arrow and Outsiders.

That sounds straightforward, doesn&#x2019;t it? Actually, it isn&#x2019;t. There are various problems. What about dinosaurs, which once existed but exist no longer? What about stars, which are so far away that, by the time their light reaches us and we can see them, they may have fizzled out?<br> <br>We&#x2019;ll come to dinosaurs and stars in a moment. But in any case, how do we know things exist, even in the present? Well, our five senses &#x2013; sight, smell, touch, hearing and taste &#x2013; do a pretty good job of convincing us that many things are real: rocks and camels, newly mown grass and freshly ground coffee, sandpaper and velvet, waterfalls and doorbells, sugar and salt. But are we only going to call something &#x2018;real&#x2019; if we can detect it directly with one of our five senses?<br> <br>What about a distant galaxy, too far away to be seen with the naked eye? What about a bacterium, too small to be seen without a powerful microscope? Must we say that these do not exist because we can&#x2019;t see them? No. Obviously we can enhance our senses through the use of special instruments: telescopes for the galaxy, microscopes for bacteria. Because we understand telescopes and microscopes, and how they work, we can use them to extend the reach of our senses &#x2013; in this case, the sense of sight &#x2013; and what they enable us to see convinces us that galaxies and bacteria exist.<br> <br>How about radio waves? Do they exist? Our eyes can&#x2019;t detect them, nor can our ears, but again special instruments &#x2013; television sets, for example &#x2013; convert them into signals that we can see and hear. So, although we can&#x2019;t see or hear radio waves, we know they are a part of reality. As with telescopes and microscopes, we understand how radios and televisions work. So they help our senses to build a picture of what exists: the real world &#x2013; reality. Radio telescopes (and X-ray telescopes) show us stars and galaxies through what seem like different eyes: another way to expand our view of reality.<br> <br>Back to those dinosaurs. How do we know that they once roamed the Earth? We have never seen them or heard them or had to run away from them. Alas, we don&#x2019;t have a time machine to show them to us directly. But here we have a different kind of aid to our senses: we have fossils, and we can see <i>them</i> with the naked eye. Fossils don&#x2019;t run and jump but, because we understand how fossils are formed, they can tell us something of what happened millions of years ago. We understand how water, with minerals dissolved in it, seeps into corpses buried in layers of mud and rock. We understand how the minerals crystallize out of the water and replace the materials of the corpse, atom by atom, leaving some trace of the original animal&#x2019;s form imprinted on the stone. So, although we can&#x2019;t see dinosaurs directly with our senses, we can work out that they must have existed, using indirect evidence that still ultimately reaches us through our senses: we see and touch the stony traces of ancient life.<br> <br>In a different sense, a telescope can work like a kind of time machine. What we see when we look at anything is actually light, and light takes time to travel. Even when you look at a friend&#x2019;s face you are seeing them in the past, because the light from their face takes a tiny fraction of a second to travel to your eye. Sound travels much more slowly, which is why you see a firework burst in the sky noticeably earlier than you hear the bang. When you watch a man chopping down a tree in the distance, there is an odd delay in the sound of his axe hitting the tree.<br> <br>Light travels so fast that we normally assume anything we see happens at the instant we see it. But stars are another matter. Even the sun is eight light-minutes away. If the sun blew up, this catastrophic event wouldn&#x2019;t become a part of our reality until eight minutes later. And that would be the end of us! As for the next nearest star, Proxima Centauri, if you look at it in 2012, what you are seeing is happening in 2008. Galaxies are huge collections of stars. We are in one galaxy called the Milky Way. When you look at the Milky Way&#x2019;s next-door neighbour, the Andromeda galaxy, your telescope is a time machine taking you back two and a half million years. There&#x2019;s a cluster of five galaxies called Stephan&#x2019;s Quintet, which we see through the Hubble telescope spectacularly colliding with each other. But we see them colliding 280 million years ago. If there are aliens in one of those colliding galaxies with a telescope powerful enough to see us, what they are seeing on Earth, at this very moment, here and now, is the early ancestors of the dinosaurs.<br> <br>Are there really aliens in outer space? We&#x2019;ve never seen or heard them. Are they a part of reality? Nobody knows; but we do know what kind of things could one day tell us if they are. If ever we got near to an alien, our sense organs could tell us about it. Perhaps somebody will one day invent a telescope powerful enough to detect life on other planets from here. Or perhaps our radio telescopes will pick up messages that could only have come from an alien intelligence. For reality doesn&#x2019;t just consist of the things we already know about: it also includes things that exist but that we don&#x2019;t know about yet and won&#x2019;t know about until some future time, perhaps when we have built better instruments to assist our five senses.<br> <br>Atoms have always existed, but it was only rather recently that we became sure of their existence, and it is likely that our descendants will know about many more things that, for now, we do not. That is the wonder and the joy of science: it goes on and on uncovering new things. This doesn&#x2019;t mean we should believe just <i>anything</i> that anybody might dream up: there are a million things we can imagine but which are highly unlikely to be real &#x2013; fairies and hobgoblins, leprechauns and hippogriffs. We should always be open-minded, but the only good reason to believe that something exists is if there is real evidence that it does.<br> <br><b>Models: testing our imagination</b><br> <br>There is a less familiar way in which a scientist can work out what is real when our five senses cannot detect it directly. This is through the use of a &#x2018;model&#x2019; of what <i>might</i> be going on, which can then be tested. We imagine &#x2013; you might say we guess &#x2013; what might be there. That is called the model. We then work out (often by doing a mathematical calculation) what we ought to see, or hear, etc. (often with the help of measuring instruments) if the model were true. We then check whether that is what we actually do see. The model might literally be a replica made out of wood or plastic, or it might be a piece of mathematics on paper, or it might be a <i>simulation</i> in a computer. We look carefully at the model and <i>predict</i> what we ought to see or hear, etc. if the model were correct. Then we look to see whether the predictions are right or wrong. If they are right, this increases our confidence that the model really does represent reality; we then go on to devise further experiments, perhaps refining the model, to test the findings further and confirm them. If our predictions are wrong, we reject the model, or modify it and try again.<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s an example. Nowadays, we know that genes &#x2013; the units of heredity &#x2013; are made of stuff called DNA. We know a great deal about DNA and how it works. But you can&#x2019;t see the details of what DNA looks like, even with a powerful microscope. Almost everything we know about DNA comes indirectly from dreaming up models and then testing them.<br> <br>Actually, long before anyone had even heard of DNA, scientists already knew lots about genes from testing the predictions of models. Back in the nineteenth century, an Austrian monk called Gregor Mendel did experiments in his monastery garden, breeding peas in large quantities. He counted the numbers of plants that had flowers of various colours, or that had peas that were wrinkly or smooth, as the generations went by. Mendel never saw or touched a gene. All he saw were peas and flowers, and he could use his eyes to <i>count</i> different types. He invented a <i>model</i>, which involved what we would now call genes (though Mendel didn&#x2019;t call them that), and he calculated that, if his model were correct, in a particular breeding experiment there ought to be three times as many smooth peas as wrinkly ones. And that is what he found when he counted them. Leaving aside the details, the point is that Mendel&#x2019;s &#x2018;genes&#x2019; were an invention of his imagination: he couldn&#x2019;t see them with his eyes, not even with a microscope. But he could see smooth and wrinkled peas, and by counting them he found indirect evidence that his <i>model</i> of heredity was a good representation of something in the real world. Later scientists used a modification of Mendel&#x2019;s method, working with other living things such as fruit flies instead of peas, to show that genes are strung out in a definite order, along threads called chromosomes (we humans have forty-six chromosomes, fruit flies have eight). It was even possible to work out, by testing models, the exact order in which genes were arranged along chromosomes. All this was done long before we knew that genes were made of DNA.<br> <br>Nowadays we know this, and we know exactly how DNA works, thanks to James Watson and Francis Crick, plus a lot of other scientists who came after them. Watson and Crick could not see DNA with their own eyes. Once again, they made their discoveries by imagining models and testing them. In their case, they literally built metal and cardboard models of what DNA might look like, and they calculated what certain measurements ought to be if those models were correct. The predictions of one model, the so-called double helix model, exactly fitted the measurements made by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, using special instruments involving X-rays beamed into crystals of purified DNA. Watson and Crick also immediately realized that their model of the structure of DNA would produce exactly the kind of results seen by Gregor Mendel in his monastery garden.<br> <br>We come to know what is real, then, in one of three ways. We can detect it directly, using our five senses; or indirectly, using our senses aided by special instruments such as telescopes and microscopes; or even more indirectly, by creating models of what <i>might</i> be real and then testing those models to see whether they successfully predict things that we can see (or hear, etc.), with or without the aid of instruments. Ultimately, it always comes back to our senses, one way or another.<br> <br>Does this mean that reality only contains things that can be detected, directly or indirectly, by our senses and by the methods of science? What about things like jealousy and joy, happiness and love? Are these not also real?<br> <br>Yes, they are real. But they depend for their existence on brains: human brains, certainly, and probably the brains of other advanced animal species, such as chimpanzees, dogs and whales, too. Rocks don&#x2019;t feel joy or jealousy, and mountains do not love. These emotions are intensely real to those who experience them, but they didn&#x2019;t exist before brains did. It is possible that emotions like these &#x2013; and perhaps other emotions that we can&#x2019;t begin to dream of &#x2013; could exist on other planets, but only if those planets also contain brains &#x2013; or something equivalent to brains: for who knows what weird thinking organs or feeling machines may lurk elsewhere in the universe?<br> <br><b>Science and the supernatural: explanation and its enemy</b><br> <br>So that is reality, and that is how we can know whether something is real or not. Each chapter of this book is going to be about one particular aspect of reality &#x2013; the sun, for instance, or earthquakes, or rainbows, or the many different kinds of animals. I want now to turn to the other key word of my title: magic. Magic is a slippery word: it is commonly used in three different ways, and the first thing I must do is distinguish between them. I&#x2019;ll call the first one &#x2018;supernatural magic&#x2019;, the second one &#x2018;stage magic&#x2019; and the third one (which is my favourite meaning, and the one I intend in my title) &#x2018;poetic magic&#x2019;.<br> <br>Supernatural magic is the kind of magic we find in myths and fairy tales. (In &#x2018;miracles&#x2019;, too, though I shall leave those to one side for now and return to them in the final chapter.) It&#x2019;s the magic of Aladdin&#x2019;s lamp, of wizards&#x2019; spells, of the Brothers Grimm, of Hans Christian Andersen and of J. K. Rowling. It&#x2019;s the fictional magic of a witch casting a spell and turning a prince into a frog, or a fairy godmother changing a pumpkin into a gleaming coach. These are the stories we all remember with fondness from our childhood, and many of us still enjoy when served up in a traditional Christmas pantomime &#x2013; but we all know this kind of magic is just fiction and does not happen in reality.<br> <br>Stage magic, by contrast, really does happen, and it can be great fun. Or at least, <i>something</i> really happens, though it isn&#x2019;t what the audience thinks it is. A man on a stage (it usually is a man, for some reason) deceives us into thinking that something astonishing has happened (it may even <i>seem</i> supernatural) when what really happened was something quite different. Silk handkerchiefs cannot turn into rabbits, any more than frogs can turn into princes. What we have seen on the stage is only a trick. Our eyes have deceived us &#x2013; or rather, the conjuror has gone to great pains to deceive our eyes, perhaps by cleverly using words to distract us from what he is really doing with his hands.<br> <br>Some conjurors are honest and go out of their way to make sure their audiences know that they have simply performed a trick. I am thinking of people like James &#x2018;The Amazing&#x2019; Randi, or Penn and Teller, or Derren Brown. Even though these admirable performers don&#x2019;t usually tell the audience exactly <i>how</i> they did the trick &#x2013; they could be thrown out of the Magic Circle (the conjurors&#x2019; club) if they did that &#x2013; they do make sure the audience knows that there was no supernatural magic involved. Others don&#x2019;t actively spell out that it was just a trick, but they don&#x2019;t make exaggerated claims about what they have done either &#x2013; they just leave the audience with the rather enjoyable sensation that something mysterious has happened, without actively lying about it. But unfortunately there are some conjurors who are deliberately dishonest, and who pretend they really do have &#x2018;supernatural&#x2019; or &#x2018;paranormal&#x2019; powers: perhaps they claim that they really can bend metal or stop clocks by the power of thought alone. Some of these dishonest fakes (&#x2018;charlatans&#x2019; is a good word for them) earn large fees from mining or oil companies by claiming that they can tell, using &#x2018;psychic powers&#x2019;, where would be a good place to drill. Other charlatans exploit people who are grieving, by claiming to be able to make contact with the dead. When this happens it is no longer just fun or entertainment, but preying on people&#x2019;s gullibility and distress. To be fair, it may be that not all of these people are charlatans. Some of them may sincerely believe they are talking to the dead.<br> <br>The third meaning of magic is the one I mean in my title: poetic magic. We are moved to tears by a beautiful piece of music and we describe the performance as &#x2018;magical&#x2019;. We gaze up at the stars on a dark night with no moon and no city lights and, breathless with joy, we say the sight is &#x2018;pure magic&#x2019;. We might use the same word to describe a gorgeous sunset, or an alpine landscape, or a rainbow against a dark sky. In this sense, &#x2018;magical&#x2019; simply means deeply moving, exhilarating: something that gives us goose bumps, something that makes us feel more fully alive. What I hope to show you in this book is that reality &#x2013; the facts of the real wo...</p><h2>The Compass (One Year Adventure Novel)</h2><p>The Compass (One Year Adventure Novel)</p><p></p><h2>Favorite Fairy Tales Told in Germany (Favorite Fairy Tales Series, 3)</h2><p>Seven well-known German tales: The Frog Prince, The Elves and the Shoemaker, Rapunzel, The Cat and the Mouse in Partnership, Rumpelstiltskin, Hansel and Gretel, and The Bremen Town Musicians.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Perky Otter: Vowel Combination er (Let&#39;s Read Together �)</h2><p><p>Perky Otter and busy Bert the Beaver learn that they have a few things in common after all.</p></p><p>Learning to read is a complex process.

He turned them down. The next time, he agreed to enter the grueling three-year training program to become a katsa, or intelligence case officer, for the legendary Israeli spy organization. By Way of Deception is the explosive chronicle of his experiences in the Mossad, and of two decades of their frightening and often ruthless covert activities around the world. Penetrating far deeper than the bestselling Every Spy a Prince, it is an insider's account of Mossad tactics and exploits. In chilling detail, Ostrovsky asserts that the Mossad refused to share critical knowledge of a planned suicide mission in Beirut, leading to the death of hundreds of U.S. Marines and French troops. He tells how they tracked Yasser Arafat by recruiting his driver and bodyguard; how they withheld information on the whereabouts of American hostages, paving the way for the Iran-Contra scandal; and how their intervention into secret UN negotiations led to the sudden resignation of ambassador Andrew Young and the downfall of his career. By Way of Deception describes the shocking scope and depth of the Mossad's influence, disclosing how Jewish communities in the U.S., Europe, and South America are armed and trained by the organization in secret ?self-defense? units, and how Mossad agents facilitate the drug trade in order to pay the enormous costs of its far-flung, clandestine operation. And it portrays a network that has grown dangerously out of control, as internal squabbles have led to the escape of terrorists and the pursuit of ?policies? completely at odds with the interests of the state of Israel. This document is possibly the most important and controversial book of its kind since Spycatcher.</p></p><p>Victor Ostrovsky was born in Canada and raised in Israel. At eighteen he became the youngest officer in the Israeli military at the time, eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant commander in charge of naval weapons testing. He was a Mossad case officer from 1982-1986. Victor Currently lives in Scottsdale Arizona where he paints and has an art gallery in old town Scottsdale.Intelligence agencies should never try to ban books about themselves. Like Peter Wright's Spycatcher (Penguin USA, 1987), which was suppressed in Britain , this book on Israel's legendary spy organization by a former Mossad katsa or case officer has ended up on the New York Times best seller list. Among the controversial revelations that led Israel to seek a ban (which was quickly overturned in the United States and Canada) is Ostrovsky's charge that the Mossad refused to share knowledge of a planned suicide mission in Beirut, resulting in the deaths of 241 U.S. Marines in 1983. Another New York Times best seller, Dan Raviv and Yossi Melman's Every Spy a Prince ( LJ 7/90), provides more reliable details on Israel's spy network.<br><i>- Wilda Wil liams, "Library Journal"</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bloody April, Black September</h2><p>In April 1917 the crews of the Royal Flying Corps and French Air Force launched a major offensive to break the frustrating and deadly stalemate on the Western Front.

Kirkus Reviews<br><br>In this sequel to Anna All Year Round (1999), nine-year-old Anna travels to spend a week in the country with Aunt Aggie and Uncle George. She is ecstatic (since all her Baltimore friends have left on vacations) until she discovers that her aunt and uncle have taken ina young orphan named Theodore. The rivalry between the children results in a series of pranks, but eventually the children become good friends. Unlike the earlier, more episodic title, the action here is more focused and the characters more fleshed out. Particularly interesting is the contrast between Anna's mother (a rigid woman with definite Old World ideas about ladylike behavior) and Aunt Aggie, who allows Anna to wear overalls for play and encourages her to have fun. The details in the setting (early-twentieth-century Baltimore, Washington and rural Prince Georges County) add to the richness of the text, as do the illustrations by Diane De Groat. A good choice for easy-chapter-book readers, especially those who have met Anna before.<br>Booklist, ALA<br><br>The nine-year-old protagonist introduced in Anna All Year Round (Clarion, 1999) is facing a long, hot Baltimore summer with no vacation plans or funds. Then her parents spring a surprise on her: she may spend a week at her uncle's farm. Anna continues throughout the novel to deal with opposing emotions. She's initially thrilled to be escaping the boredom of the city, but then fears being so far from her parents. After arriving at the farm, she gloomily discovers another guest, her uncle's nephew Theodore. He torments her continuously, calling her a city slicker, locking her in the henhouse, etc. Not being a meek or mousy child, Anna one-ups him each and every time. When the week has ended, they've come to a respectful understanding. Anna then faces her mother's horror at finding her daughter freckled, dirty, and wearing overalls. The novel is rollicking fun and gives a great glimpse of life in pre-World War I America. Readers will love the battle of wills Anna and Theodore fight before becoming friends, and their humorous escapades during the week together. De Groat's full-page sketch for each of the 13 chapters is perfectly in tune with the mood of the story.

The magazine published twenty stories by this stellar group of writers over the course of the summer. They are now collected for the first time in one volume.</p><p>The range of voices is extraordinary. There is the lyrical realism of Nell Freudenberger, Philipp Meyer, C. E. Morgan, and Salvatore Scibona; the satirical comedy of Joshua Ferris and Gary Shteyngart; and the genre-bending tales of Jonathan Safran Foer, Nicole Krauss, and T�a Obreht. David Bezmozgis and Dinaw Mengestu offer clear eyed portraits of immigration and identity; Sarah Shun-lien Bynum, ZZ Packer, and Wells Tower offer voice-driven, idiosyncratic narratives. Then there are the haunting sociopolitical stories of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Daniel Alarc�n, and Yiyun Li, and the metaphysical fantasies of Chris Adrian, Rivka Galchen, and Karen Russell.</p><p>Each of these writers reminds us why we read. And each is aiming for greatness: fighting to get and to hold our attention in a culture that is flooded with words, sounds, and pictures; fighting to surprise, to entertain, to teach, and to move not only us but generations of readers to come.

In the glare of the hot afternoon, in the swirl of motorcycles and hawkers, she was looking down at me from the back seat of her jeep. Her stare was too direct, not sufficiently vacant. She was not merely resting her eyes on the car next to hers, as people often do in Lagos traffic; she was looking at me. At first, I glanced away, but then I stared back, at the haughty silkiness of the weave that fell to her shoulders in loose curls, the kind of extension called Brazilian Hair and paid for in dollars at Victoria Island hair salons; at her fair skin, which had the plastic sheen that comes from expensive creams; and at her hand, forefinger bejewelled, which she raised to wave a magazine hawker away, with the ease of a person used to waving people away. She was beautiful, or perhaps she was just so unusual-looking, with wide-set eyes sunk deep in her face, that &#x201c;beautiful&#x201d; was the easiest way of describing her. She was the kind of woman I imagined my lover&#x2019;s wife was, a woman for whom things were done.</p><p>My lover. It sounds a little melodramatic, but I never knew how to refer to him. &#x201c;Boyfriend&#x201d; seemed wrong for an urbane man of forty-five who carefully slipped off his wedding ring before he touched me. Chikwado called him &#x201c;your man,&#x201d; with a faintly sneering smile, as though we were both in on the joke: he was not, of course, mine. &#x201c;Ah, you are always rushing to leave because of this your man,&#x201d; she would say, leaning back in her chair and smacking her head with her hand, over and over. Her scalp was itchy beneath her weave, and this was the only way she could come close to scratching it. &#x201c;Have fun oh, as long as your spirit accepts it, but as for me, I cannot spread my legs for a married man.&#x201d; She said this often, with a clear-eyed moral superiority, as I packed my files and shut down my computer for the day.</p><p>We were friends out of necessity, because we had both graduated from Enugu Campus and ended up working for Celnet Telecom, in Lagos, as the only females in the community-relations unit. Otherwise, we would not have been friends. I was irritated by how full of simplified certainties she was, and I knew that she thought I behaved like an irresponsible, vaguely foreign teen-ager: wearing my hair in a natural low-cut, smoking cigarettes right in front of the building, where everyone could see, and refusing to join in the prayer sessions our boss led after Monday meetings. I would not have told her about my lover&#x2014;I did not tell her about my personal life&#x2014;but she was there when he first walked into our office, a lean, dark man with a purple tie and a moneyed manner. He was full of the glossy self-regard of men who shrugged off their importance in a way that only emphasized it. Our boss shook his hand with both hands and said, &#x201c;Welcome, sir, it is good to see you, sir, how are you doing, sir, please come and sit down, sir.&#x201d; Chikwado was there when he looked at me and I looked at him and then he smiled, of all things, a warm, open smile. She heard when he said to our boss, &#x201c;My family lives in America,&#x201d; a little too loudly, for my benefit, with that generic foreign accent of the worldly Nigerian, which, I would discover later, disappeared when he became truly animated about something. She saw him walk over and give me his business card. She was there, a few days later, when his driver came to deliver a gift bag. Because she had seen, and because I was swamped with emotions that I could not name for a man I knew was wrong for me, I showed her the perfume and the card that said, &#x201c;I am thinking of you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Na wa! Look at how your eyes are shining because of a married man. You need deliverance prayers,&#x201d; Chikwado said, half joking. She went to night-vigil services often, at different churches, but all with the theme Finding Your God-Given Mate; she would come to work the next morning sleepy, the whites of her eyes flecked with red, but already planning to attend another service. She was thirty-two and tottering under the weight of her desire: to settle down. It was all she talked about. It was all our female co-workers talked about when we had lunch at the cafeteria. Yewande is wasting her time with that man&#x2014;he is not ready to settle down. Please ask him oh, if he does not see marriage in the future then you better look elsewhere; nobody is getting any younger. Ekaete is lucky, just six months and she is already engaged. While they talked, I would look out the window, high up above Lagos, at the acres of rusted roofs, at the rise and fall of hope in this city full of tarnished angels.</p><p>Even my lover spoke of this desire. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll want to settle down soon,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I just want you to know I&#x2019;m not going to stand in your way.&#x201d; We were naked in bed; it was our first time. A feather from the pillow was stuck in his hair, and I had just picked it out and showed it to him. I could not believe, in the aftermath of what had just happened, both of us still flush from each other&#x2019;s warmth, how easily the words rolled out of his mouth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not like other men, who think they can dominate your life and not let you move forward,&#x201d; he continued, propping himself up on his elbow to look at me. He was telling me that he played the game better than others, while I had not yet conceived of the game itself. From the moment I met him, I had had the sensation of possibility, but for him the path was already closed, had indeed never been open; there was no room for things to sweep in and disrupt.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re very thoughtful,&#x201d; I said, with the kind of overdone mockery that masks damage. He nodded, as though he agreed with me. I pulled the covers up to my chin. I should have got dressed, gone back to my flat in Surulere, and deleted his number from my phone. But I stayed. I stayed for thirteen months and eight days, mostly in his house in Victoria Island&#x2014;a faded-white house, with its quiet grandeur and airy spaces, which was built during British colonial rule and sat in a compound full of fruit trees, the enclosing wall wreathed in creeping bougainvillea. He had told me he was taking me to a Lebanese friend&#x2019;s guesthouse, where he was staying while his home in Ikoyi was being refurbished. When I stepped out of the car, I felt as though I had stumbled into a secret garden. A dense mass of periwinkles, white and pink, bordered the walkway to the house. The air was clean here, even fragrant, and there was something about it all that made me think of renewal. He was watching me; I could sense how much he wanted me to like it.</p><p>&#x201c;This is your house, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t belong to your Lebanese friend.&#x201d;</p><p>He moved closer to me, surprised. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t misunderstand. I was going to tell you. I just didn&#x2019;t want you to think it was some kind of...&#x201d; He paused and took my hand. &#x201c;I know what other men do, and I am not like that. I don&#x2019;t bring women here. I bought it last year to knock it down and build an apartment block, but it was so beautiful. My friends think I&#x2019;m mad for keeping it. You know nobody respects old things in this country. I work from here most days now, instead of going to my office.&#x201d;</p><p>We were standing by sliding glass doors that led to a veranda, over which a large flame tree spread its branches. Wilted red flowers had fallen on the cane chairs. &#x201c;I like to sit there and watch birds,&#x201d; he said, pointing.</p><p>He liked birds. Birds had always been just birds to me, but with him I became someone else: I became a person who liked birds. The following Sunday morning, on our first weekend together, as we passed sections of Next to each other in the quiet of that veranda, he looked up at the sky and said, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a magpie. They like shiny things.&#x201d; I imagined putting his wedding ring on the cane table so that the bird would swoop down and carry it away forever.</p><p>&#x201c;I knew you were different!&#x201d; he said, thrilled, when he noticed that I read the business and sports sections, as though my being different reflected his good taste. And so we talked eagerly about newspapers, and about the newscasts on AIT and CNN, marvelling at how similar our opinions were. We never discussed my staying. It was not safe to drive back to Surulere late, and he kept saying, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you bring your things tomorrow so you can go to work from here?&#x201d; until most of my clothes were in the wardrobe and my moisturizers were on the bathroom ledge. He left me money on the table, in brown envelopes on which he wrote &#x201c;For your fuel,&#x201d; as if I could possibly spend fifty thousand naira on petrol. Sometimes, he asked if I needed privacy to change, as if he had not seen me naked many times.</p><p>We did not talk about his wife or his children or my personal life or when I would want to settle down so that he could avoid standing in my way. Perhaps it was all the things we left unsaid that made me watch him. His skin was so dark that I teased him about being from Gambia; if he were a woman, I told him, he would never find a face powder that matched his tone. I watched as he carefully unwrapped scented moist tissues to clean his glasses, or cut the chicken on his plate, or tied his towel round his waist in a knot that seemed too elaborate for a mere towel, just below the embossed scar by his navel. I memorized him, because I did not know him. He was courtly, his life lived in well-oiled sequences, his cufflinks always tasteful.</p><p>His three cell phones rang often; I knew when it was his wife, because he would go to the toilet or out to the veranda, and I knew when it was a government official, because he would say afterward, &#x201c;Why won&#x2019;t these governors leave somebody alone?&#x201d; But it was clear that he liked the governors&#x2019; calls, and the restaurant manager who c...</p></p><h2>Twelve Prophets (Soncino Books of the Bible) (English and Hebrew Edition)</h2><p>The Twelve Prophets: Hebrew Text and English Translation</p><p>Text: English, Hebrew</p><h2>The Sandburg Connection (Sam Blackman Series)</h2><p><p>It should have been routine, a simple assignment for PI Sam Blackman and his partner Nakayla Robertson.

Military commentator and historian Albert A. Nofi presents the war as a coherent military narrative, showing the confluence of the American command's Civil War experience and recent developments in technology. Serious attention is also given to the Spanish forces, the army of an empire in decline, but well-equipped and tactically sophisticated.Detailed coverage is given of both American and Spanish aims, assumptions and strategy. The author's colorful narrative is supplemented by 50 illustrations, most of which have not appeared in print since the era of the war.Specially commissioned maps highlight the most tactically significant land and naval engagements, such as the Spanish defense of El Caney and the Spanish fleet's dramatic but futile attempt to break out of Santiago harbor.Military operations are placed in the context of a growing American nation in a wider world, 35 years after the Civil War. <i>The Spanish American War</i> features a detailed treatment of the war in Puerto Rico. This theater was under the command of Indian fighter Nelson A. Miles and included some of the best tactical maneuvering of the war. The Puerto Rican aspect has not been covered in detail in modern works.Albert Nofi has made use of works covering the Spanish that have not been widely used in English-language works, as well as American eyewitness accounts that have not been examined in nearly a century.</p><p><b>Albert A.

Primarily because I am the son of a psychiatrist and grew up in the surroundings of &#x201c;insane asylums,&#x201d; as they were called in Denmark in the late ?fties and early sixties; and although my father was extremely progressive and a new thinker in his ?eld, I couldn&#x2019;t avoid witnessing ?rst-hand how the mentally ill were treated in those days. Many of them had been in the system since the thirties and I was interested in the methods of treatment and the doctors and hospitals during that period, and especially during the war. I got to know a few patients who&#x2014;through the eyes of a na�ve, alert child&#x2014;I suspected of simulating their mental illness.</p><p>One of these chronically mentally ill patients basically coped with life in the hospitals by uttering only two sentences. &#x201c;Yes, you&#x2019;ve got a point there!&#x201d; was the one he used the most. He wasn&#x2019;t sticking his neck out here. Then he could enhance and round off practically any situation with a sincerely relieved &#x201c;Oh, thank God!&#x201d; He was one of the patients I suspected of having retreated from society into the calm and peaceful world of medical treatment facilities by using some obscure form of simulation.</p><p>But is it possible to preserve oneself and one&#x2019;s mind in a situation like this if one isn&#x2019;t really ill? It&#x2019;s hard to believe, especially considering some of the hefty methods of treatment used at the time. Wouldn&#x2019;t our verbally limited patient become ill sooner or later?</p><p>My father met the patient again after a period of many years. It was in the seventies, by which point the world had become freer in many ways. This had also had its effect on our man. He&#x2019;d added a third sentence to his repertoire: &#x201c;Up yours!&#x201d; He&#x2019;d kept up with the times.</p><p>And again I found myself wondering: Is he ill or is he well?</p><p>My desire to combine these two objects of my fascination&#x2014;the possibly mentally ill individual and World War II&#x2014;was enhanced by a conversation I had with one of my mother&#x2019;s friends named Karna Bruun. She had worked as a nurse in Bad Kreuznach under Professor Ferdinand Sauerbruch and was able to con?rm and expand upon some theories I&#x2019;d developed.</p><p>In the summer of 1987, under the starry Italian skies of Terracina, I outlined my ?edgling story for my wife. Then, as now, I had the greatest admiration for authors for whom research and literary expertise were inseparable. She believed my story would be worth this kind of effort.</p><p>It took me almost eight years to realize.</p><p>In the course of this period I&#x2019;ve been grateful to Det Treschowske Fideikommis for their assistance in the form of a travel grant to Freiburg im Breisgau, where a large portion of the story unfolds; to the military library in Freiburg; and to Oberarchivrat Dr. Ecker from Stadtarchiv Freiburg.</p><p>Since then, my wife, Hanne Adler-Olsen, has been my tireless muse and critic, constantly nurturing my faithfulness to my original ambitions.</p><p>In the perusal of my manuscript by my capable and wise friends&#x2014; Henning Kure, Jesper Helbo, Tomas Stender, Eddie Kiran, Carl Rosschou, and not least of all my sister, Elsebeth W�hrens, and my mother, Karen-Margrethe Olsen&#x2014;the story underwent a multilayered process that made it both shorter and more profound. All elements were assessed and pondered over until the story came to fruition as I&#x2019;d hoped.<br><br></p><p>Jussi Adler-Olsen<br></p><p> <br><br><b>PART I</b><br></p><p> <br><b>CHAPTER 1<br></b></p><p> It wasn&#x2019;t the best weather in the world.</p><p>Cold and windy, with poor visibility.</p><p>An exceptionally bleak January day, even for England.</p><p>The American crews had already been sitting on the landing strips for some time when the tall Englishman approached. He was still not quite awake.</p><p>Behind the group a shape rose halfway to its feet and waved to him. The<br>Englishman waved back, yawning loudly. Functioning in daytime was dif?cult after such a long period with nothing but night raids.</p><p>It was going to be a long day.</p><p>At the far end of the air?eld the planes were taxiing slowly toward the southern end of the landing strips. Soon the air would be full of them</p><p>The feeling was both exhilarating and oppressive.<br>The orders regarding the mission came from Major General Lewis H. Brereton&#x2019;s office in Sunninghill Park. He was requesting British assistance from Sir Arthur Harris, marshal in the Royal Air Force. The Americans were still impressed by the British Mosquitoes&#x2019; discovery, during their November nighttime bombing of Berlin, of the Germans&#x2019; most closely guarded secret, the V-1 missile sites at Zempl�n.</p><p>The choice of British personnel had been left to Group Captain Hadley-Jones, who entrusted the practical work to his next-in-command, Wing Commander John Wood.</p><p>The latter&#x2019;s task was to select twelve British ?ight crews. Eight of them were to function as instructors and four as supporting crews with special photo-reconnaissance duties under the 8th and 9th American Air Forces.</p><p>Two-seater P-51D Mustang ?ghters had been equipped for this task with radar and sensitive optical instruments.</p><p>Only two weeks had passed since James Teasdale and Bryan Young had been chosen as the ?rst crew to try out this equipment under so-called &#x201c;normal conditions.&#x201d;</p><p>In short, they could expect to go into action again.</p><p>The raid was planned for the eleventh of January, 1944. The targets were the airplane factories at Oschersleben, Braunschweig, Magdeburg, and Halberstadt.</p><p>Both men had protested about having their Christmas leave curtailed. They were still suffering from combat fatigue.</p><p>&#x201c;Two weeks to ?gure out this bloody machine!&#x201d; Bryan shook his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know a thing about all those gadgets. Why doesn&#x2019;t Uncle Sam do his own dirty work?&#x201d;</p><p>John Wood was standing with his back to them both, bowed over the document ?les. &#x201c;Because Uncle Sam wants you!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s no argument, is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll live up to the Americans&#x2019; expectations and come out alive.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Is that a guarantee?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Say something, James!&#x201d; Bryan turned toward his friend.</p><p>James ?ngered his silk scarf and shrugged. Bryan sat down heavily. </p><p>It was hopeless. They had to go.<br>The entire operation was calculated to take a good six hours. A total of about 650 four-engine bombers from the 8th American Air Force were to bomb airplane factories, escorted by the P-51 long-distance ?ghters.</p><p>Bryan and James were to break away from the other P-51s during the attack.</p><p>During the past couple of months, there had been persistent rumors of an increased in?ux of building craftsmen, engineers, and highly specialized technicians&#x2014;as well as hordes of Polish and Soviet slave laborers&#x2014;into the region of Lauenstein, south of Dresden.</p><p>Intelligence had learned that some kind of construction was going on in the area, but not what kind. They had a hunch it might be factories for producing synthetic fuel. If this were the case, it would be a dangerous development that could lend impetus to new German V-bomb projects.</p><p>Bryan and James&#x2019;s job, therefore, was to thoroughly photograph and map out the area, including the railway network around Dresden, so Intelligence could update its information. After completing their mission they were to rejoin the formation on its way back to England.<br>Many of the Americans who were to take part in the raid were already seasoned air warriors. Despite the cold and the impending takeoff, they were lying half stretched out on the uneven, frostbitten earth some people called a landing strip. Most of them were chatting away as though they were on their way to a dance or relaxing at home on the family sofa. Here and there a few sat hugging their knees, staring dully into space. These were the new and inexperienced airmen who had not yet learned how to forget their dreams and control their anxiety.</p><p>The Englishman strode between the sitting ?gures toward his partner, who lay stretched out on the ground with his arms behind his head.</p><p>Bryan gave a start when he felt the gentle kick in his side.</p><p>Snow?akes drifted above them, settling on nose and brow as the sky became more and more overcast. This expedition would differ very little from one of their night raids.<br>Bryan&#x2019;s seat vibrated gently under him.</p><p>The radar screen showed the surrounding air space to be thick with signals from the planes in the formation. Each echo that signaled a plane&#x2019;s position was clearly distinguishable.</p><p>Several times during training they&#x2019;d joked about painting the windows over and ?ying on instruments alone. The equipment was that precise. It was a joke they could just as well have taken seriously on this ?ight. According to James, the visibility was &#x201c;as clear as a symphony by B�la Bart�k.&#x201d; The windshield wipers and nose of the plane penetrating the snow clouds&#x2014;that was all they could see.</p><p>They&#x2019;d been arguing. Not about the crazy idea of changing duties and equipment at such short notice, but about John Wood&#x2019;s motives. According to Wood they had been chosen because they were the best, which James was willing to accept.</p><p>But Bryan blamed his friend. There was scarcely any doubt in his mind that John Wood had picked them because James never protested while on active duty. And on this operation there had certainly been no time for questioning orders.</p><p>Bryan&#x2019;s reproaches irritated James. There were worries enough already. It was a long trip and they were handling new equipment. The weather was terrible and there was no one to support them once they left the rest of the formation. If Intelligence was correct in assuming that important factories were under construction, the target area would be very heavily guarded. Finally, it was going to be an extremely difficult task getting the photos back to England.</p><p>But James was right. Someone had to do it. Besides, it couldn&#x2019;t be much different from the bombing raids on Berlin.</p><p>They&#x2019;d made it this far.</p><p>Bryan sat silently in his seat behind James, doing his job irreproachably, as always. The vibrations gradually shook loose his combed-back hair. Bryan&#x2019;s hairstyle was his most distinguishing feature. Freshly combed, he looked almost as tall as James.</p><p>Between Bryan&#x2019;s map and measuring instruments hung the photo of a<br>WAC by the name of Madge Donat. In her eyes, Bryan was an Adonis.</p><p>He&#x2019;d stuck with her for a long time.<br>As if responding to the authoritative cue of a conductor&#x2019;s baton, the Germans began greeting the arriving planes with an antiaircraft overture. James had foreseen the barrage a few seconds previously and given Bryan the signal, so they managed to change course. From that moment until some unpredictable time in the future their fate was out of their hands.</p><p>Unprotected and on their own.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be scraping the ass off this machine if you want us to ?y any lower,&#x201d; Bryan grunted twenty minutes later.</p><p>&#x201c;If we stay up at two hundred feet, your pictures won&#x2019;t come out,&#x201d; came the reply. </p><p>James was right. It was snowing over the target area, but the wind was constantly forcing the ?akes to whirl upward, creating holes through which it was possible to photograph. Assuming they were close enough.</p><p>No one had been interested in their presence since they&#x2019;d turned away from the barrage over Magdeburg. Apparently they hadn&#x2019;t been observed. Bryan would do his utmost to see they weren&#x2019;t.</p><p>Many planes had crashed behind them. Far too many. In the midst of all the noise, James shouted back to Bryan that he&#x2019;d seen German ?ghters<br>?ring rocketlike things. A short ?ash followed by a totally devastating explosion.</p><p>&#x201c;The Luftwaffe isn&#x2019;t worth a shit,&#x201d; an American pilot had bellowed out the previous evening, a broad Kentucky grin on his face. Perhaps experience had taught him something different now.</p><p>&#x201c;And then 138 degrees to the south!&#x201d; Bryan was following the sea of snow beneath him. &#x201c;You should be able to get a glimpse of the main road out of Heidenau. Can you see the crossroads now? Good. Then follow the turning toward the ridge.&#x201d;</p><p>Their speed was down to scarcely two hundred kilometers per hour, which in that weather made the entire fuselage complain audibly.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to zigzag over the road here, James, but watch out! Some of the southern slopes could be steep. Can you see anything? You should have a good chance between here and Geising.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All I can see is that the road seems quite wide. Why would that be, in such a deserted place?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I was wondering. Can&#x2019;t you swing southward now? Look at those trees! Can you see how dense they are?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Camou?age netting, you mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Possibly.&#x201d; If there were any factories here, they must have been dug into the hillside. Bryan doubted that. Once such a building was discovered, the earthworks wouldn&#x2019;t provide sufficient protection against intense precision bombing. &#x201c;This is a wild-goose chase, James! There&#x2019;s nothing in the vicinity to suggest recent building.&#x201d;</p><p>If possible, they were to follow the railway line northward toward Heidenau, turn west toward Freital and follow the railway line to Chemnitz, then turn north and later northeast along the railway line to Waldheim. The entire network was to be photographed in detail. By Russian request. Soviet troops were exerting heavy pressure near Leningrad and were threatening to roll up the entire German front. According to the Russians, the railway junction at Dresden was the Germans&#x2019; umbilical cord. Once severed, the German divisions on the Eastern Front would soon be lacking supplies. It was merely a question of how many cuts were necessary in order to be effective.</p><p>Bryan looked down at the railway line beneath him. There would be nothing to see in his photos but snow-covered rails.</p><p>The ?rst explosion came without warning and with incredible force, only a half meter behind Bryan&#x2019;s seat. Before he could turn around, James was already forcing the plane into a fast vertical climb. Bryan fastened the snap hook in his seat and felt the cockpit&#x2019;s tepid air being sucked out from under him.</p><p>The jagged hole in the fuselage was about the size of a ?st; the exit hole in the roof, like a dinner plate. A single round from a small-caliber antiaircraft gun had hit them.</p><p>So there was something they&#x2019;d overlooked after all.<br>The engine screeched so loudly during the steep ascent that they couldn&#x2019;t tell if they were still being shot at.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it serious back there?&#x201d; James screamed. He appeared satis?ed with the answer. &#x201c;Then here we go!&#x201d; Almost instantly James had looped the loop, tipped the plane on one side, and put it into a vertical dive. After a few seconds the Mustang&#x2019;s machine guns began ticking away. Several antiaircraft muzzle ?ames pointed directly up at them, showing them the way.</p><p>In the midst of that deadly blaze there had to be something the Germans were extremely reluctant to have outsiders know about.</p><p>James swung the plane from side to side in order to confuse the enemy while the German gunners on the ground tried to get them in their sights. They never saw the guns, but there was no mistaking the sound. The Flakzwilling 40 made a bloodcurdling noise all of its own.</p><p>When they were close to the ground, James leveled the plane with a jerk. They would only have this one chance. The entire area was two to ...</p></p><h2>Elephants (Worldlife Library) by Poole, Joyce (2001) Paperback</h2><p>This top-selling series introduces the wild creatures of the world and examines the natural world.

In this exciting collection, Brueggemann finds that when we admit we are dust, we can be liberated. Why? Because we are free from acting like God. We are free to choose obedience to the one living, true Sovereign. The idols lose their grip on us and we live faithfully and in authentic joy&#34; -Ronald J. Allen, Christian Theological Seminary &#34;According to Walter Brueggemann, the autonomy, secularity, and individualism that characterize modernity have &#39;exiled&#39; the contemporary believer. Always concerned with the manner in which one is to live in the world, he argues for a subversive imagination similar to that found in the biblical wisdom writings, the Psalms, and the Prophets. One comes away from this book both energized by the vision presented and challenged to make it a reality&#34; -Dianne Bergant, Catholic Theological Union in Chicago &#34;There is a reason why Walter Brueggemann remains, for preachers and pastors, the most loved and trusted of all biblical scholars-and that is simply because he writes for us. In every season and heartbreak of life and ministry, he writes for us. And over the years, we have come to see that when Brueggemann goes to the text before God, with his signature passion, candor, and ferocious energy, he goes not for our enlightenment or edification, but for our life and for his. Read this book and take off your shoes, because you will enter onto holy ground&#34; -Anna Carter Florence, Columbia Theological Seminary</p><p></p><h2>Aang&#39;s School Days (2) (Avatar)</h2><p><i>#1 Sokka, the Sword Master: </i>The adventures of Aang and his friends continue in <i>Sokka, the Sword Master</i>, the first of two brand-new <i>Avatar </i>Level 3 Ready-to-Reads!

Humiliated, penniless, pregnant, and very much alone, Jana reluctantly turns to her mother, Eleanor, in desperation. Eleanor is haunted by her own guilt and pain, and the arrival of her daughter only serves as a daily reminder of the memories she has long kept hidden away. Will a delightfully eccentric aunt become a catalyst between these two women? Will they allow God&#39;s spirit--and God&#39;s people--to bring true healing...and a future filled with love?</p><p>Tracie Peterson is the bestselling, award-winning author of over 60 historical and contemporary novels, including the bestselling Westward Chronicles and Heirs of Montana series. She and her family make their home in Montana.Adultery, incest, drugs, attempted suicide, foster parent abuse, murder, rape&#x2014;these and other traumas feature in this latest from a bestselling Christian author. When the pregnant Jana McGuire returns from a mission trip, she's stunned to find that her husband, a pastor, has run off with his secretary and cleaned out her bank account. Angry and grieving, she moves to Montana to live with her estranged and unbelievably heartless mother, Eleanor, and quirky octogenarian aunt Taffy, the most likable character in the book. Peterson explains Eleanor's cruelty with flashback chapters to her childhood on a commune. Although Eleanor's incestuous relationship with her father in these flashback chapters is the axis of the story, much of what occurs feels vaguely like filler. Wooden emotions ("Why is this happening?") and Christian clich�s abound. When Jana asks the "other woman" to have Thanksgiving dinner with her as an act of forgiveness, readers may find the plot twist difficult to swallow. Some victims of incest may appreciate the story as a vehicle for emotional healing, but it falls short of skilled fiction. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Set against the French and Indian siege of Fort William Henry in 1757, &#34;The Last of the Mohicans&#34; recounts the story of two sisters, Cora and Alice Munro, daughters of the English commander, who are struggling to be reunited with their father. They are aided in their perilous journey by Hawk-eye, a frontier scout and his companions Chingachgook and Uncas, the only two survivors of the Mohican tribe. But their lives are endangered by the Mangua, the savage Indian traitor who captures the sisters, wanting Cora to be his squaw. In setting Indian against Indian and the brutal society of the white man against the civilization of the Mohican, Cooper, more than any author before or since, shaped the American sense of itself as a nation.</p><p>James Fenimore Cooper (1789 &#x2013; 1851) was a prolific and popular American writer of the early 19th century. His historical romances of frontier and Indian life in the early American days created a unique form of American literature. He lived most of his life in Cooperstown, New York, which was established by his father William. Cooper was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church and in his later years contributed generously to it. He attended Yale University for three years, where he was a member of the Linonian Society, but was expelled for misbehavior.</p><h2>Dada Art and Anti-Art</h2><p><p><strong>"One of the best documents on this extraordinary movement."�&#x20ac;&#x201d;<em>The Sunday Times</em></strong></p>�&#x20ac;&#x2dc;Where and how Dada began is almost as difficult to determine as Homer�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s birthplace�&#x20ac;&#x2122;, writes Hans Richter, the artist and film-maker closely associated with this radical and transforming movement from its earliest days. Here he records and traces Dada�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s history, from its inception in about 1916 in wartime Zurich, to its collapse in Paris in 1922 when many of its members were to join the Surrealist movement, down to the present day when its spirit re-emerged first in the 1960s with, for example, Pop Art. <br><br> This absorbing eye witness narrative is greatly enlivened by extensive use of Dada documents, illustrations and a variety of texts by fellow Dadaists. It is a unique document of the movement, whether in Zurich, Berlin, Hanover, Paris or New York. The complex relationships and contributions of, among others, Hugo Ball, Tristan Tzara, Picabia, Arp, Schwitters, Hausmann, Duchamp, Ernst and Man Ray, are vividly brought to life. 179 Illustrations, 8 in color</p><p>Hans Richter was well known both as a painter and film-maker. While in Zurich from 1916-20, he started the Dada movement with Hugo Ball, Tristan Tzara and others. In 1940 he left Europe for the US and became an American citizen. His films include: Vormittagspuk, Dreams that Money Can Buy, Dadascope and 8 x 8, produced in collaboration with Arp, Calder, Duchamp, Ernst, Huelsenbeck, Man Ray and others. His paintings hang in galleries throughout the world, and he is the author of several books on the cinema and art.Hans Richter, who died in 1976, was well known as both a painter and a filmmaker.

The LSH was relegated to seven-page stories in the back of Superboy's comic (and not even every issue), and because that's not the ideal format to cover 30 heroes, most of the stories concentrate on a couple Legionnaires. Soon the Legion became popular enough that the title eventually became <i>Superboy Starring the Legion of Super-Heroes</i>, and the issues in this volume do contain a number of milestones of Legion lore. Wildfire makes his debut as an applicant named ERG-1 in issue #195, Bouncing Boy and Duo Damsel get married in issue #200, and then there were the sexy new costumes, including Saturn Girl's pink bikini and Phantom Girl's bell bottoms. The 232-page book includes biographies of the creative talent (including one-shot inker Mike Grell, who would go on to make his own mark on the Legion) and a nice introduction by the artist who grew up on the Legion during this period, Dave Cockrum, before he went on to help reinvent the X-Men. <i>--David Horiuchi</i></p><h2>The Study of Plant Communities: An Introduction to Plant Ecology</h2><p>An Introduction to Plant Ecology; Craft Paper Protective Jacket To Hardbound book</p><p></p><h2>InuYasha, Vol. 14</h2><p>Wounded in a battle with his brother, Seshomaru receives aid from a young girl who is subsequently killed when her village is attacked by the wolf-warrior Kouga, a situation that tempts him to use the power of his life-giving sword.

The neon green from the Boston Garden billboards, the purple beacons decorating the white-cabled Zakim Bridge, the glaring yellow of the chopper&#x2019;s spots colored the crime scene into a B-movie carnival. &#x201c;Are you calling it a serial killing? You think it&#x2019;s one person? Was she killed the same way as the other?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, tell us, Jake,&#x201d; another voice demanded. &#x201c;Is two murders serial?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;One a couple weeks ago, one today, that&#x2019;s two.&#x201d; A different reporter&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;Both women.

The Bridge Killer.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Have you figured out who the first victim is?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Outta here<i>,</i> all of you!&#x201d; Jake tucked his flashlight under one arm, zipped his Boston Police&#x2013;issue brown leather jacket. Reporters scrambling to nickname a murderer. Crazy. <i>What does Jane always say? It bleeds, it leads? At least her stories aren&#x2019;t like that.</i> A siren screamed across Causeway Street; then the red-striped ambulance careened down the rutted side street. Every camera turned to the EMTs scrambling out the opening ambulance doors.<br><i>No need for them to hurry,</i> Jake thought. His watch showed 2:15 A.M. She&#x2019;d been dead for at least three hours.<br>Just like the other woman.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Jane Ryland had thrown up after the verdict.<br>She&#x2019;d twisted her damp hair away from her face, avoided the mirror, and contemplated how long she could hide in the Suffolk County Courthouse ladies&#x2019; room. <i>Forever would be good.</i> Instead, she&#x2019;d gritted out a smile for the scrum of cameras as Channel 11&#x2019;s defense attorney promised her television colleagues an immediate appeal of the jury&#x2019;s decision. The two then marched down the granite steps of the courthouse, the lawyer&#x2019;s pin-striped arm protectively across Jane&#x2019;s shoulder, as if a million-dollar damage verdict were the honorable cost of doing journalism business.<br>But soon after, Jane could read the counterfeit smiles, rescheduled meetings, abysmal story assignments. Her TV reporting career was over. She&#x2019;d protected a source, but nobody was protecting her.<br>MILLION-DOLLAR MISTAKE, the headlines screamed. RYLAND NAMES WRONG MAN AS JOHN IN SEX-FOR-HIRE CASE. Indy rag <i>Boston Weekly</i> called her &#x201c;Wrong-Guy Ryland.&#x201d;<br>Jane knew she hadn&#x2019;t been wrong. There&#x2019;d been no mistake, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. Days later she was fired.<br>&#x201c;And most incredibly bogus of all, they pretended it wasn&#x2019;t about the verdict.&#x201d; Jane had banged out a bitter and bewildered e-mail to her pal Amy. Once newbie co-anchors together in Iowa, Amy had landed a high-profile reporter gig in Washington, D.C., then Jane got a similar deal in Boston. Amy&#x2019;s star was still rising. Plus, as she never let Jane forget, <i>she</i> was married.<br>&#x201c;After three years of promos, all those promises,&#x201d; Jane typed, &#x201c;they said they wanted to &#x2018;go another direction&#x2019; with their political coverage. Are you kidding me? There&#x2019;s an election coming. It&#x2019;s the biggest story since the Kennedy thing. What the hell other direction can they go?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry, Janey honey,&#x201d; Amy typed back. &#x201c;They had to blame somebody. Everyone hates TV reporters. And everybody hates TV. I&#x2019;m probably next, you know? We should have gotten real jobs, kiddo.&#x201d;<br>Now Alex Wyatt&#x2014;<i>Register</i> city editor Alex Wyatt, of all people!&#x2014;was about to offer Jane a real job. Such as it was. At least the <i>Register</i>&#x2019;s headlines had been objective. GROCERY MAGNATE WINS SLANDER SUIT.<br>Jane closed her eyes briefly at the memory. Dad would take care of her, if it came to that, even urge her to come home to Oak Park. Then he&#x2019;d probably urge her to go to law school, like younger sister, engaged sister, good sister Lissa. Dad would be supportive, at least try to be, but Dr. Ryland never approved of failure. She was on her own. And she&#x2019;d be fine.<br>Perched on the couch in Alex&#x2019;s new and already file-strewn office at the <i>Boston Register,</i> surrounded by the clutter of his half-unpacked boxes, Jane was working hard at being fine.<br>She wished she could just say no. Leave town. Change her name. Forget the jurors, forget the verdict. Talk to her mom just one more time.<br>But reality included a hefty mortgage on her condo, payments on her suddenly extravagant Audi TT, looming utility bills, and evaporating severance pay. She&#x2019;d once reported heartbreakingly headlined stories about the terrors of unemployment. Now she was unemployed. Jane knew she&#x2019;d tell Alex yes.<br>&#x201c;I vouched for you with the bigs on the fifth floor.&#x201d; Alex positioned a framed Columbia J-school diploma against one beige wall, raised his wire-rimmed glasses to his forehead, then marked the wall with a pencil, turning his back to her. &#x201c;Told &#x2019;em you were nails on the street. Tough and fair. Beat me on a couple stories, that&#x2019;s for sure. The hospital thing last year, remember?&#x201d;<br><i>I sure do.</i> &#x201c;The hospital thing&#x201d; was an overnight stakeout of a politician injured in a suspicious hit and run. Alex and Jane, each refusing to leave while the other kept watch, shared the last of the murky coffee. Jane had secretly contemplated sharing a lot more than coffee. Luckily, as she later admitted to Amy, she&#x2019;d checked Alex&#x2019;s third finger, left hand. <i>Taken.</i> At least she&#x2019;d eventually gotten an exclusive interview with the victim.<br>Alex was still talking. &#x201c;But here at the paper, we respect reporters who protect their sources. We don&#x2019;t fire them. Told &#x2019;em I figured your source threw you under the bus.&#x201d;<br>He turned to her, glasses back in place and pencil now behind his ear. &#x201c;Speaking of which. About the case. Sellica Darden told you, didn&#x2019;t she? She had to be your source. Want to talk about it? Off the record?&#x201d;<br><i>Not now, not ever</i>. &#x201c;Lawyers, you know? The appeal?&#x201d; Jane smoothed her black wool skirt over her knees, carefully pulling the hem over her best black leather boots. Looking anywhere but at Alex. Why didn&#x2019;t life have an &#x201c;Undo&#x201d; button? She hadn&#x2019;t realized she was risking her career for Sellica. She tried to keep the sorrow out of her voice. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. I really can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>Alex narrowed his eyes. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing that&#x2019;ll hurt the paper, though, right? Nothing&#x2019;ll come back to bite us? All any of us has is our reputation, you know?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Jane said.<br><i>Mortgage. Heat. Health insurance. Food. Mom would have said, &#x201c;Jane Elizabeth, you should remember every closed door means another door opens.&#x201d;</i><br>&#x201c;You can trust me, Alex. I know times are tough for newspapers. I&#x2019;m grateful Jake&#x2014;Detective Brogan&#x2014;called you about me. I&#x2019;m grateful, really, for the opportunity.&#x201d;<br>The room went silent.<br>Maybe Alex was getting cold feet, no matter what Jake had told him. Maybe no one would trust her again. The jury was wrong, not her. But how can you battle perception? Jane gathered her black leather tote bag, ready to be dismissed. Maybe it was too soon. Or too late.<br>Leaving his framed diploma propped on top of a peeling radiator, Alex leaned against the side of his battered wooden desk. He smiled, running a hand across its pitted wood. &#x201c;They told me T. R. Baylor himself, founder of the <i>Register,</i> used this very desk back in the day. Brinks job, Mayor Curley, the Boston Strangler. All the Kennedys. They offered me a new desk, you know? But keeping this one seemed right.&#x201d;<br>Jane smiled back. &#x201c;Wonder what T.R. would think about your Internet edition? And maybe there&#x2019;s a new Boston Strangler now, the one they&#x2019;re calling the Bridge Killer.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Times change; news doesn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Alex replied. &#x201c;People sure don&#x2019;t. The <i>Register</i>&#x2019;s covering it, but we&#x2019;re not calling anyone the Bridge Killer yet, that&#x2019;s for sure. Who knows if those killings are connected? But yeah, you can&#x2019;t understand the future if you don&#x2019;t understand the past.

No Survivors to Tell the Story! So read newspaper headlines after Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer's command of the 7th Cavalry was annihilated by a host of Indians at the Little Bighorn River on 25 June 1876. Since then, Custer and his tragic fate have become a legend enshrouded in myth, controversy, and the celluloid fantasies of Hollywood.<br>Over the years, historians have focused primarily on the Last Stand, Custer and his troops making a desperate effort to save themselves from inevitable disaster. Too often this approach has ignored the great panorama surrounding the event. In The Little Bighorn Campaign, Custer authority Wayne Michael Sarf investigates the 1876 campaign against the Plains Indians, a play in which Custer acted a part along with many others. Sarf describes the personalities and events that led to the disaster at Little Bighorn from a failed attempt to subdue the Indians at the Powder River to Brigadier General George Crook's defeat at the Rosebud to Buffalo Bill's first scalp for Custer.<br>Sarf also investigates and describes the nature of Plains warfare, the weapons that were used, the forces involved, and the strategies and tactics employed by Army troops and the Indians. Special sidebars include such topics as the personalities involved, Indian allies of the Army, and a history of the 7th Cavalry. Answers are given to some of the most nagging questions of Little Bighorn: was Custer betrayed? could gatling guns have spared him from his awful fate? and what actually happened there? The Custer buff will enjoy the orders of battle for both the Indians and Army, while the interested novice will find useful the suggested books and movies to read, see, or avoid.</p><p></p><h2>Two Minutes to Glory: The Official History of the Kentucky Derby</h2><p><blockquote><p>Take a front row seat at "the Run for the Roses" with the first comprehensive history of the Kentucky Derby.</p></blockquote><p>From mint juleps to the garland of roses, to weeping men and women in the Winner's Circle, <em>Two Minutes to Glory</em> is the official story of the world's greatest horse race&#x2014;the Kentucky Derby.</p><p>This book is chockablock with facts, figures, and statistics on all 132 years of this incredible race. It also contains a capsuled yet detailed history of the race and of Churchill Downs, focusing on all the larger-than-life personalities from Col. M. Lewis Clark, who founded the Derby in 1875, to Col. Matt Winn, who saved it when it was in the stretch, out of breath, about to break down, and in need of a miracle&#x2014;and beyond that to the present day.</p><p>But perhaps the best parts of this lavishly illustrated book are the stories of the races, from 1875 to 2006. It is not a mere recitation of what happened&#x2014;though there is that&#x2014;but the human (and horse) stories behind the races, like that of Conn McCreary, who, astride Count Turf in 1951, looked down the track before the gates opened and knew that he was riding not just to win the Derby, but for his life. Or the 2005 race where a seventy-nine-year-old woman named Alice Chandler burst into tears as she watched her 50-1 shot Giacomo roar down the stretch to win&#x2014;but also cried because she knew that when just a foal, he had previously beaten an opponent called death. This book looks at all the people and horses who made the Derby what it is over the years: trainer Ben A. Jones with six Derby winners; Eddie "Banana Nose" Arcaro and Secretariat, who broke the two-minute barrier and ran the fastest Derby in history; the great owners, the grooms&#x2014;and all the rest.

His target: the ringmaster himself. Struggling to elude the menace, Dr. Show scraps his ambitious itinerary, ticket sales plummet, and nothing but disaster looms. The troupe&#39;s unravelling hopes fall on their latest and most promising recruit, Webern Bell, a sixteen-year-old stunted hunchback devoted obsessively to perfecting the surreal clown performances that come to him in his dreams.

In this comprehensive study, Ronald D. Cohen reconstructs the history of this singular cultural moment, tracing its origins to the early decades of the twentieth century. Drawing on scores of interviews and numerous manuscript collections, as well as his own extensive files, Cohen shows how a broad range of traditions&#x2013;from hillbilly, gospel, blues, and sea shanties to cowboy, ethnic, and political protest music&#x2013;all contributed to the genre known as folk. He documents the crucial work of John Lomax and other collectors who, with the assistance of recording companies, preserved and distributed folk music in the 1920s. During the 1930s and 1940s, the emergence of left-wing politics and the rise of the commercial music marketplace helped to stimulate wider interest in folk music. Stars emerged, such as Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly, Pete Seeger, Burl Ives, and Josh White. With the success of the Weavers and the Kingston Trio in the 1950s, the stage was set for the full-blown "folk revival" of the early 1960s. Centered in New York's Greenwich Village and sustained by a flourishing record industry, the revival spread to college campuses and communities across the country. It included a wide array of performers and a supporting cast of journalists, club owners, record company executives, political activists, managers, and organizers. By 1965 the boom had passed its peak, as rock and roll came to dominate the marketplace, but the folk revival left an enduring musical legacy in American culture.</p><p>A well-informed chronicle of the folk music boom in mid-twentieth-century America.Ronald D.

Since 1979, more than 10 years before the new wave of Indie pictures challenged the conventions of Hollywood moviemaking, Sayles has been creating magnificent and utterly original films. Even more remarkably, they differ radically from one another. Who could guess that the director of <i>The Return of the Secaucus Seven</i> and <i>Baby It's You</i> could turn around and make <i>The Brother from Another Planet</i>, that the man behind the fabulous <i>Secret of Roan Inish</i> was capable also of the socially conscious <i>Matewan</i>, <i>City of Hope</i>, and <i>Lone Star</i>? <p> This interview book, another in Faber and Faber's remarkable series devoted to filmmakers on their work, is published to coincide with the release of <i>Men with Guns</i>, Sayles's film for 1998. The director speaks about the way he works ("I wrote <i>The Brother from Another Planet</i> in about a week."), the themes of his films ("There is a fantasy children's movie in <i>The Secret of Roan Inish</i>, but finally there is also this realistic core to it."), and his political sensibilities ("One of the ideas I was trying to get at in <i>Lone Star</i> is that race is an illusion but culture is very real."). Perhaps because he is such a fine writer, Sayles proves an amazingly articulate speaker. Fans of the director, as well as those discovering Sayles for the first time, will be delighted by the director's personal insights and stories.</p><b>Gavin Smith</b> is a contributing editor to <i>Film Comment</i>.<br></p><h2>Telephone: The First Hundred Years</h2><p>A centennial history of Mr. Bell&#39;s invention, its impact on and importance in American life, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the world&#39;s largest corporation</p><p></p><h2>The Sen-Toku Raid</h2><p>U.S. Navy Underwater Demolition Team officer Lieutenant Charlton Randall must destroy a Japanese Sen-Toku class submarine, a huge vessel that can carry kamikaze fighters and manned torpedoes.</p><p>John Mannock delivers heart-stopping action. -- <i>Joe Buff, author of <i>Tidal Rip</i></i></p><h2>The Push Man and Other Stories</h2><p><b>A collection of short stories from the grandfather of Japanese alternative comics.</b><br><br>Legendary cartoonist Yoshihiro Tatsumi is the grandfather of alternative manga for the adult reader.

Each hinges on some kind of prurient or sexually twisted situation: a man's bedridden lover turns out to be a physically mutated sex slave; an office worker puts on his girlfriend's makeup and clothes and has an affair with another woman; a man who disinfects telephones for a living calls a prostitute, but can't think of anything to do but pull out his disinfection kit. Produced over a short period of time, the stories are variations on a theme of social maladjustment. Tatsumi draws marvelously evocative settings, and his stories flow with dreamlike ambiguity, speeding toward the inevitable tragedies at their ends, but his characters appear practically identical. This reinforces both the repetitive nature of his themes and Tatsumi's view of the common man's continuing struggle in a merciless world of menial jobs, impotence and abortions. Tatsumi is known as the "grandfather of Japanese alternative comics," and this is the first in a proposed series of authorized English-language collections of his work. His work anticipates American alternative comics, making it clear why American cartoonist Adrian Tomine, who edited this collection, was attracted to the work. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

These essays focus on coalitions and alliances in which feminists and other activists joined forces to address crucial social justice issues such as reproductive rights, the peace movement, women's health, Christianity and other religions, and neighborhood activism, as well as alliances crossing boundaries of race, class, political views, and sexual identity. The contributors bring fresh perspectives to feminist history by calling attention to how women struggled to include and represent diverse women without minimizing the difficulties of conceptualizing a singular feminism.&nbsp; </p><p>Contributors are Maria Bevacqua, Tamar Carroll, Marisa Chappell, Andrea Estepa, Sara M.

Yet for all the books, blogs and conferences, there are two staggering realities we must come to grips with: First, while most churches believe they have leadership development programs, in actuality, they have programs that recruit and train volunteers, not leaders. A volunteer is someone who executes someone else&#39;s vision. A leader is someone with a vision of their own. In truth, there are often only a few leaders in the average church and everyone else are simply executing their vision. It&#39;s the genius with a thousand helpers. Perhaps more troubling, though, is that our development programs are not about releasing leaders to the missional frontier, but volunteers keeping the machine of the church running. To be sure, we should attend to the organization of the church, for it is a significant thing when the scattered church gathers. But as the Church stares precipitous decline in the face-as we look to re-embrace the missio Dei-we must learn again the art that Jesus mastered: the task of multiplying missional leaders and releasing them to the cracks and crevices of society where there is little-to-no Kingdom presence. People often like quippy sayings like, &#34;We want to be known more for our sending capacity than our seating capacity.&#34; This book is about how that can become a reality in your community.</p><p></p><h2>Sacred Monsters</h2><p>Edmund White is one of our most celebrated novelists.

Literally. I was a lonely gay kid living in the dorms at an all boys&#x2019; school where I would have been beat up if anyone had guessed my inclinations. I was quietly arty I listened to classical records over at the music building and on my own turntable during the two fifteen-minute periods when we were free to do what we wanted to. I read novels and by the time I had graduated I&#x2019;d even written two of them (still unpublished). <br><br> My boy&#x2019;s school was Cranbrook, outside Detroit, now long since co-ed but at that time strictly segregated from its sister school, Kingswood, and from the art academy, which was just across the street. The academy trained college-age students in all the arts, from silkscreening to sculpture. In our own small school library I discovered a big book on Rodin with black and white illustrations. I checked it out and took it to my room (we each lived in private rooms).<br><br> There I pored over the picture of the statue for weeks on end while I was supposed to be studying and by flashlight after bedtime and lights out. I had no friends, certainly no lovers, but the life-size statue of this 22-year-old Belgian soldier, whose name I learned was Auguste Neyt, became the center of all my fantasies. The statue, at least to the eyes of Rodin&#x2019;s contemporaries, seemed so disturbingly lifelike that he&#x2019;d been accused of casting it from life, of pressing the plaster moulds directly to the model&#x2019;s flesh, as if he were a George Segal avant la lettre. Although Rodin had made a trip to Italy and looked at various Michelangelos while working on The Age of Bronze (the neutral, mysterious title he gave to the work when it was eventually cast in bronze and exhibited in Paris), nevertheless the figure is less heavily muscled than the sculpture of the Renaissance and modeled in such a way that it made the light falling on it shimmer. <br><br> There is something tragic about the statue and some of Rodin&#x2019;s contemporaries thought it must show someone about to commit suicide. This and other interpretations were licensed because the sculpture, oddly for the period, had no visible pretext. The statue was completed after 18 months of work in 1877, when Rodin (a late bloomer) was already 37. The French had recently suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Prussians and perhaps this terrible reversal was in everyone&#x2019;s minds at the time. For me the pose of the raised arm and the parted lips looked both melancholy and sensual, as did the impressionistic modeling of the body surface. The figure was obviously a fine specimen of maleness but the face expressed great vulnerability, and the combination made me think of the photos I&#x2019;d seen of Nijinsky dancing the role of the Favorite Slave in Ssheherazade , pictures I&#x2019;d devoured when I read his biography written by his wife, who was surprisingly frank about her husband&#x2019;s affair with his impresario, Diaghilev. <br><br> Of course our formalist critics today teach us not to confuse art with life, but when I was an adolescent Rodin&#x2019;s art this one sculpture had replaced life. I wanted somehow to marry him, to live with him the rest of my life. Since Auguste Neyt had already been dead for half a century, surely, my union with him was preposterous, impossible something that took me out of time and history and propelled me into an ideal world of timeless desire. That conundrum how to marry a man already dead for half a century when the statue was Rodin&#x2019;s invention and not the soldier and marriage to any member of the same sex was unthinkable was my introduction to the ideal and excrutiatingly improbable realm of art.</p><h2>The Buddha Next Door: Ordinary People, Extraordinary Stories</h2><p>Through personal experiences, this anthology illuminates how the practice of Nichiren Buddhism has changed people&#x2019;s lives for the better.

With Music and Justice for All is a collection of Gaillard's most compelling work, one writer's odyssey though a time and place. There are stories here of the civil rights movement, a moral, social and political upheaval that changed the South in so many ways. Gaillard has captured the essence of that drama by giving it a face--telling the stories of the ordinary people, as well as the icons. In the course of these pages, the reader not only meets Dr. Martin Luther King, but also the lesser known heroes such Perry Wallace--the first African American basketball player in the Southeastern Conference and Thomas Gilmore, the first black sheriff in one of the toughest counties in the Alabama Black Belt, a man of non-violence, who refused, in deference to the fallen Dr. King, to carry a gun during the thirteen years he served as sheriff.<p><br><br>But Gaillard examines the South from other angles as well--the religious heritage, for example, that once led Flannery O'Connor to write about a "Christ-haunted" South. We meet Billy Graham, the greatest evangelist of his time, who admitted in the course of interviews with Gaillard that his ministry represented a "very narrow gift." There are profiles here of the Southern Baptist renegade Will Campbell and former President Jimmy Carter, whose commitment to his own understanding of Christianity has sometimes led him into controversy. Gaillard writes also about the revealing power of Southern music--how the great Johnny Cash, for example, became a force for reconciliation in America. In the final section of the book we meet some of the characters Gaillard has covered through the years, including John T. Scopes, whose final public appearance Gaillard wrote about as a young reporter in Nashville.</p></p><p>One writer&#39;s odyssey though a time and place.

Back then, we pronounced it &#x201c;Teen,&#x201d; but it was just our word for river.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As we sat, and Mam wept and cursed with fury, we heard screams from across the water. The smell of smoke from the burning wooden fort on the clifftop drifted toward us. People--our neighbors mostly--huddled on the opposite bank, but Dag the ferryman was not going to go back for them. Not now: he would be killed too. He had run away from us, stammering apologies, as soon as his raft had touched the shore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Above the people cowering on the bank, the men who had come in boats appeared. They paused--arrogantly, fearlessly--then walked over to their prey, swords and axes at the ready. I saw some people entering the water to try to escape.

Visit him at AndrewNagorski.com.The Nazi Hunters Introduction<p></p> <br>One of the most famous German films right after the end of World War II was called Die M�rder sind unter uns&#x2014;&#x201c;The Murderers Are Among Us.&#x201d; Susanne Wallner, a concentration camp survivor played by Hildegard Knef, returns to her devastated apartment in the ruins of Berlin. She finds Hans Mertens, a former German army surgeon already living there, succumbing to alcoholism and despair. The surgeon runs into his former captain, now a prosperous businessman, who had ordered the Christmas Eve massacre of one hundred civilians in a Polish village in 1942. Haunted by such memories, Mertens decides to kill the captain on the first postwar Christmas Eve.<br> <br>At the last moment, Wallner convinces Mertens that such an act of vigilante justice would be a mistake. &#x201c;We cannot pass sentence,&#x201d; she tells him. The surgeon understands. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Susanne,&#x201d; he replies as the film ends. &#x201c;But we must bring charges. Demand atonement on behalf of millions of innocent murder victims.&#x201d;<br> <br>The film was a spectacular success, attracting huge audiences. But its message was fundamentally misleading. It was left to the Allies, not to the German people, to arrange the early war crimes trials. The victors soon largely abandoned such efforts, focusing instead on the emerging Cold War. As for most Germans, they were far more eager to forget their recent past than to contemplate atonement.<br> <br>Among the chief perpetrators who were not immediately arrested or who were caught and not initially recognized by their Allied captors, there was certainly no talk of atonement either. There was only the impulse to flee. In Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s case, it was by committing suicide in his bunker along with Eva Braun, whom he had just married. After poisoning their six children, Joseph Goebbels, his propaganda chief, and his wife, Magda, followed suit. In the 1976 bestselling novel The Valhalla Exchange, the fictional Goebbels explains why he chose that course. &#x201c;I have no intention of spending the rest of my life running around the world like some eternal refugee,&#x201d; he declares.<br> <br>But most of his colleagues and other Nazis guilty of war crimes had no intention of following Hitler&#x2019;s example. Many of the lower ranking perpetrators did not even feel compelled to hide: they quickly blended in with the millions who were seeking to rebuild their lives in a new Europe. Others, who felt more at risk, found ways to flee the continent. For a long time, it looked like many of the people in both categories had succeeded in eluding responsibility for their crimes, often with the support of loyal family members and networks of Kameraden&#x2014;Nazi Party comrades.<br> <br>This book focuses on the relatively small band of men and women&#x2014;both those serving in official positions and those operating independently&#x2014;who worked to reverse their initial successes, not letting the world forget their crimes. These pursuers demonstrated tremendous determination and courage as they kept up their fight even when the governments representing the victors and the rest of the world grew increasingly indifferent to the fates of the Nazi war criminals. In the process, they also explored the nature of evil and raised profoundly troubling questions about human behavior.<br> <br>Those who have attempted to bring the murderers to justice have been loosely labeled as Nazi hunters&#x2014;but they have not been anything like a group with a common strategy or basic agreement on tactics. They often have been at odds with each other, prone to recriminations, jealousies, and outright rivalries, even as they pursued roughly the same goals. In some cases, this undoubtedly weakened their effectiveness.<br> <br>But even if everyone involved in the pursuit of Nazi criminals had put aside their personal differences, the results would not have been significantly different. And by any absolute measure, those results can&#x2019;t justify the claim that justice was done. &#x201c;Anyone who seeks a balance between the crimes that were committed and the punishment will be ultimately frustrated,&#x201d; said David Marwell, a historian who has worked for the Justice Department&#x2019;s Office of Special Investigations, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the Berlin Document Center, and served as the director of the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York. As for the original pledge of the victors to prosecute all of those responsible for war crimes, he curtly added: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too difficult.&#x201d;<br> <br>Too difficult to succeed on a grand scale, yes, but the efforts by those who refused to give up on the notion of holding at least some Nazi war criminals to account developed into an ongoing postwar saga unlike any other in the history of mankind.<br> <br>At the end of past wars, the victors often killed or enslaved the vanquished, plundering their lands and exacting speedy retribution. Summary executions, not trials or any other legal proceedings aimed at weighing the evidence to determine guilt or innocence, were the norm. Revenge was the motive, pure and simple.<br> <br>Many of the Nazi hunters were also initially motivated by revenge, particularly those coming out of the camps or those victors who helped liberate them and saw the stunning evidence of the horrors that the fleeing Nazis left behind: the dead and the dying, the crematoriums, the &#x201c;medical&#x201d; facilities that served as torture chambers. As a result, some Nazis and their collaborators were at the receiving end of immediate retribution at the end of the war.<br> <br>But from the first Nuremberg trials to the hunt for war criminals in Europe, Latin America, the United States, and the Middle East that has sporadically continued to this day, the Nazi hunters have focused most of their efforts on initiating legal proceedings against their prey&#x2014;demonstrating that even the most obviously guilty should have their day in court. It was no accident that Simon Wiesenthal, the most famous Nazi hunter, titled his memoirs Justice Not Vengeance.<br> <br>Even when justice was so obviously falling short, with the guilty often getting away with the mildest punishments or in many cases not facing any sanctions at all, the other goal that began to emerge was education by example. Why pursue an aging camp guard during his final days? Why not let the perpetrators quietly fade away? Many U.S. officials were more than happy to do so, especially as their attention was diverted to a new enemy&#x2014;the Soviet Union. But the individual Nazi hunters were not about to let go, arguing that each case offered valuable lessons.<br> <br>The point of the lessons: to demonstrate that the horrendous crimes of World War II and the Holocaust cannot and should not be forgotten, and that those who instigated or carried out those crimes&#x2014;or others who may carry out similar crimes in the future&#x2014;are never beyond the law, at least in principle.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>In 1960 when a Mossad team kidnapped Adolf Eichmann in Argentina and flew him to Israel for trial, I was thirteen years old. I have no recollection of how much I was aware of what had happened, whether I was paying attention to the media coverage at all, but something had clearly sunk in. I know that because of a vivid memory from the following summer when Eichmann was already on trial in Jerusalem.<br> <br>During a family visit to San Francisco, I was sitting in a luncheonette with my father. At one point, I started examining the face of an old man sitting at the other end of the counter. I leaned over to my father, pointed him out and whispered: &#x201c;I think that may be Hitler.&#x201d; My father grinned and let me down gently. Of course I had no idea then that, while working on this book half a century later, I would interview Gabriel Bach, the last surviving prosecutor in the Eichmann trial, and the two Mossad agents who led the team that seized him.<br> <br>Eichmann&#x2019;s kidnapping, trial, and hanging marked the beginning of a growing awareness that many Nazi criminals had gone unpunished, and signaled a gradual revival in interest in their crimes. It also soon spawned an outpouring of books and movies about Nazi hunters, often based more on myths than realities. I avidly read those books and watched those movies, fascinated by the characters&#x2014;both the heroes and the villains&#x2014;as much as by the nonstop action.<br> <br>There was much more than the great chase that captured the popular imagination. Especially for the postwar generation, the larger questions about the nature of the people who were objects of that chase, and even about their family and neighbors, were just as riveting. To this day, there are no easy answers to the question why so many millions of Germans and Austrians, along with collaborators in most of the lands they conquered, could have willingly enlisted in a movement dedicated to mass murder.<br> <br>During my stints as Newsweek&#x2019;s bureau chief in Bonn, Berlin, Warsaw, and Moscow during the 1980s and 1990s, I often found myself examining the legacy of the war and the Holocaust. Whenever I lapsed into thinking I would encounter no more surprises, only variations of similar stories, I was brought up short by some startling new revelation.<br> <br>In late 1994, I was preparing my report for a cover story Newsweek had scheduled to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz on January 27, 1995. I had interviewed numerous survivors from many countries in Europe. Each time I was uneasy asking them to relive the horrors of those years, and I always told them to feel free to stop at any point if they felt the process was too painful. In most cases, though, the stories poured out of them; once they started, they just kept going and no further prompting was necessary. No matter how many such stories I heard, I was always mesmerized&#x2014;and at times truly stunned.<br> <br>After interviewing a Dutch Jewish survivor whose story was particularly moving, I automatically apologized for making him go through it in such detail, saying that of course he must have told his family and friends about his odyssey many times. &#x201c;I never told anyone,&#x201d; he replied. Seeing my expression of disbelief, he added: &#x201c;No one ever asked.&#x201d; He had carried his burden all alone for fifty years.<br> <br>Three years later another encounter offered a glimpse of those who carry a very different kind of burden. I interviewed Niklas Frank, the son of Hans Frank, who had served as Hitler&#x2019;s governor general of Poland during the occupation, presiding over an empire of death. A journalist and author who described himself as a typical European liberal, Niklas cared deeply about democratic values. He took a special interest in Poland, particularly during the 1980s when the independent trade union Solidarity was leading the human rights struggle that ultimately toppled that country&#x2019;s communist regime.<br> <br>Born in 1939, Niklas was only seven when he saw his father for the last time in Nuremberg, shortly before he was hanged as a war criminal. Along with his mother, he was led into the prison. His father pretended that nothing was amiss. &#x201c;Well, Nikki, soon we&#x2019;ll all be together again for Christmas,&#x201d; he said. The young boy left &#x201c;seething mad,&#x201d; he recalled, because he knew his father was about to be hanged. &#x201c;My father lied to everyone, even his own son,&#x201d; he said. Later in life he thought about what he wished his father had said instead: &#x201c;Dear Nikki, I&#x2019;ll be executed because I did terrible things. Don&#x2019;t lead the kind of life I led.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then came another line I will always remember. Describing his father as &#x201c;a monster,&#x201d; he declared: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m against the death penalty, but I believe my father&#x2019;s execution was totally justified.&#x201d;<br> <br>In all my years as a foreign correspondent, I had never heard anyone speak that way about a father. That sentiment led Niklas to one more conclusion. He pointed out that Frank is a common name and most people he meets don&#x2019;t know that he is the son of a major war criminal unless he tells them. Nonetheless, he knows the truth and cannot put it out of his mind. &#x201c;There isn&#x2019;t a day when I don&#x2019;t think about my father and especially everything that the Germans did,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The world will never forget this. Whenever I go abroad and say that I&#x2019;m German, people think &#x2018;Auschwitz.&#x2019; And I think that&#x2019;s absolutely just.&#x201d;<br> <br>I told Niklas that I felt lucky that I did not have to live with his sense of inherited guilt, since, as it happened, my father fought on the losing side when Germany invaded Poland in 1939. I knew that rationally the happenstance of birth is no reason to feel morally superior or inferior. Niklas knew that, too. But I fully understood why his one wish in life was to have a father he didn&#x2019;t have to be ashamed of.<br> <br>Niklas&#x2019;s attitude was hardly typical for family members of Nazi war criminals. But to my mind his raw, brutal honesty exemplified what is best in Germans today&#x2014;the willingness of many of them to confront, on a daily basis, their country&#x2019;s past. It took a long time for that to happen, though, and much of that would never have happened at all if it were not for the Nazi hunters and their arduous, often lonely struggles, not just in Germany and Austria, but all over the world.<br> <br>That struggle is now coming to an end. Most of the Nazi hunters, along with the hunted, will soon only exist in our collective memories, where myth and reality are likely to become even more intertwined than they are today.

Before Nat Culver, a son of a translator, finds out answers to these questions, he is plunged into a series of baffling incidents concerning accusations made against his father.

Every one of us has described some other person as crazy or insane, and most all of us have had periods, moments at least, of madness. But it took the confluence of the law and medical science, mad-doctors, alienists, priests and barristers, to raise the matter to a level of science,&#x201d; capable of being used by conniving relatives, designing families&#x201d; and scheming neighbors to destroy people who found themselves in the way, people whose removal could provide their survivors with money or property or other less frivolous benefits. <i>Girl Interrupted</i> in only a recent example. And reversing this sort of diagnosis and incarceration became increasingly more difficult, as even the most temperate attempt to leave these homes&#x201d; or hospitals&#x201d; was deemed crazy.&#x201d; Kept in a madhouse, one became a little mad, as Jack Nicholson and Ken Kesey explain in <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. </i> <br><br>In this sadly terrifying, emotionally moving, and occasionally hilarious book, twelve cases of contested lunacy are offered as examples of the shifting arguments regarding what constituted sanity and insanity. They offer unique insight into the fears of sexuality, inherited madness, greed and fraud, until public feeling shifted and turned against the rising alienists who would challenge liberty and freedom of people who were perhaps simply difficult,&#x201d; but were turned into victims of this unscrupulous trade.<br><br>This fascinating book is filled with stories almost impossible to believe but wildly engaging, a book one will not soon forget.<br></p><p><b>Sarah Wise</b> studied at Birkbeck College at the University of London.

In Morris's soulful point of view, sports is about growing up in America, radio broadcasts of the Brooklyn Dodgers in a Mississippi country store, girls with double names, practical jokes, small town coaches, the hold the past has on us, about running effortlessly in the sun. The novella, "The Fumble," is a sports classic about high school football in the Deep South. Set in the 1950s it describes a confrontation of mythic proportions between a small town football team from the "Delta" and the omnipotent Central High Tigers of Jackson, Mississippi. Each of the six autobiographical essays in this book form chapters of a Great American boyhood, beginning with Morris's farewells to high school and to American legion baseball, a road trip to Notre Dame with "Bevo," the University of Texas longhorn steer mascot, Rhodes scholars playing basketball in England, a writers-and-artists softball game in East Hampton, New York, in which the author admits he is too old to run the bases, and finally a journey back to Austin, Texas, in search of the past. To Willie Morris, sports are a gentle center in the eye of the storm, a clean world of instinct and action where one can work out the bruises of living, where the rituals of youth teach valuable lessons about winning and losing, about heroes and disillusionment, about finding a way to face the world.</p></p><p>Willie Morris was editor-in-chief of Harper&#39;s magazine from 1967 to 1971. He grew up in Yazoo City, Mississippi, attended the University of Texas and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. His books include Always Stand In Against the Curve, North Toward Home, Good Old Boy: A Delta Boyhood, Terrains of the Heart, The Courting of Marcus Dupree, Taps, James Jones: A Friendship, and New York Days.Literate sports fans will appreciate the language (&#34;There, as sweet and effortless as a Mozart minuet, all alone for a few yards deep into the end zone on the buttonhook, was Billy Bonner.&#34;); they will enjoy his sense of humor (the decor in an Austin Mexican restaurant is described as &#34;Tex-Mex Kafka.&#34;)....There are some great old photos ( Yazoo in the early 1950); and there is a lot of love in this book. It is, as Morris asserts, &#34;a family album of sorts.&#34; And those who stumble upon this gem from the Yoknapatawpha Press will be in for a treat. Booklist March 15, 1984 The high and low points of Morris&#39;s career as a high school athlete form the basis of most of the tales, which Morris tells in a straightforward, heartfelt manner. ...He still regrets the key fumble that might&#39;ve cost his football team the most important game of the 1951 season, and he still has nightmares about Seth Morehead&#39;s unhittable curveball, which proved to be too much for Morris and his teammates in the 1952 Mississippi high school baseball tournament.... Morris is not hunting metaphors when he describes fumbles and curveballs. He remembers sports fondly and writes about them with care and precision. San Diego Union January 22, 1984 With the resonance of heady nostalgia, Willie Morris remembers well his Delta boyhood, savoring still the crossroads store with sawdust on the floor and the practical jokes and the &#34;pretty girls with double names&#34; and the ritual of team sport, of playing on high school football fields with their nightswarm of high-flying insects and on baseball fields surrounded by cotton in full growth.... If the book&#39;s title is evocative metaphor, it is also a summing up of how Willie Morris would indeed always stand in against the curve as he went to bat facing life&#39;s bitter bruises and its golden times. Both are remembered with equal grace in this exquisitely written search for the past. Arkansas Gazette December 18, 1983 The tales that Morris spins in Always Stand In Against the Curve parallel his own growth and development beginning with his schoolboy days in Mississippi, continuing to his college days at the University of Texas (where he was editor of The Daily Texan), extending to Europe with his receipt of a Rhodes scholarship. The longest piece of the collection, &#34;The fumble,&#34; is a certifiable minor masterpiece. It is Morris&#39;s finest effort in the volume and an unusually valuable piece of 1950s Americana in its own right. It re-creates the magnified traumas and triumphs of high school football in the south....Along with a heartbreakingly predictable athletic drama, the story finally examines the sense of community that turns whole southern towns into single-minded, crepe paper-draped booster organizations....a macroscopic view of one of the most endearing social rituals of the south. Morris&#39;s sure narrative touch lends a poignant and personalized nature very rare to modern writing. The Houston Post From boyhood to middle-age, in places as far apart as Oxford, England, and Austin, Texas, Morris has enjoyed adventures as athlete and fan. Charm and mischief mark the best stories, as when Morris tells of driving his college mascot, the University of Texas longhorn steer all the way to a football game at Notre Dame....All the pieces are deeply felt, and some evoke the dreamlike playing fields of Morris&#39;s youth. Los Angeles Times The stories bring back what it was like to be seventeen in small town Mississippi. More important, they revive memories of what it was like to be an adolescent anywhere. The Milwaukee Journal&#34;</p><h2>Bierstadt&#39;s West</h2><p>Albert Bierstadt (1830-1902) took his first trip West early in 1859 with Frederic Lander. He was chosen to be a civilian artist on a government expedition which set out to improve the wagon roads of the South Pass from Fort Kearny to the eastern border of California. By the middle of the year, Bierstadt was following the same steps taken by Alfred Jacob Miller twenty-two years earlier, on the Oregon Trail. Along the way he met and sketched thousands of discouraged gold seekers and immigrants. In late summer he returned east and began turning his sketches into huge canvases. Included among some of these earlier scenes were Chimney Rock, Fort Laramie and Laramie Park.<br><br> Bierstadt's second trip, this time to the far West, took place in 1863. He traveled with his friend Fitz Ludlow. They spent several weeks in Yosemite Valley beyond the Sierra Nevada, eventually traveling up into Oregon. By 1864, scarcely five years after painting his first Rocky Mountain picture, Bierstadt was the most highly acclaimed American painter, rivaling even Frederick Church.<br><br> As an artist, Bierstadt was concerned more with communicating his image of the West to the American public than with following changing styles in the art world. For him, the immensity of the Rocky Mountains could find appropriate expression only on large canvases. Despite their size, and the immensity of terrain represented, he also managed to include a lavish amount of detail, particularly in his foregrounds. As a consequence, he was often criticized in later years for overstatement, for combining several paintings into one canvas, sometimes from different perspectives. When he did not lose sight of the whole in his efforts to combine large vistas and accurate amounts of detail, the impact of his work could be universalizing.</p><p></p><h2>Life in the Rocky Mountains: A Diary of Wanderings on the Sources of the Rivers Missouri, Columbia, and Colorado, 1830-1835</h2><p>This memoir by adventurer Warren Angus Ferris offers an in-depth and first-hand tale of the Rocky Mountains and its neighboring rivers, as they were during the 1830s. Beginning with an enthusiastic cry of &#34;Westward, Ho!&#34;, we are taken on a journey by Ferris, who proves a lively and thoroughly readable commentator. His adventures with the groups of hunters and traders are varied and numerous, and the tone of his writing does a fine job capturing the spirit of risk taking and excitement of venturing to the unknown which characterized the era. We receive descriptions of the rugged and sometimes breathtaking wilderness, the Native American tribes and their warriors and their leadership, and the trade of furs which drove a great part of the westward expansion. The many perils of the frontier wilderness, from fierce animals and bears, to thieves and bandits, to hostile groups of Native Americans, were all encountered by Ferris in his years navigating the great mountain ranges.</p><p></p><h2>The Rape of the Nile</h2><p>The scandalous rape of Ancient Egypt is a historical vignette of greed, vanity, and dedicated archaeological research. It is a tale vividly told by renowned archaeology author, Brian Fagan, with characters that include the ancient historian Herodotus; Theban tomb robbers; obelisk-stealing Romans; Coptic Christians determined to erase the heretical past; mummy traders; leisured antiquarians; major European museums; Giovanni Belzoni, a circus strongman who removed more antiquities than Napoleon's armies; shrewd consuls and ruthless pashas; and archaeologists such Sir Flinders Petrie who changed the course of Egyptology.This is the first thoroughly revised edition of <i>The Rape of the Nile</i> - Fagan's classic account of the cavalcade of archaeologists, thieves, and sightseers who have flocked to the Nile Valley since ancient times. Featured in this edition are new accounts of stunning recent discoveries, including the Royal Tombs of Tanis, the Valley of Golden Mummies at Bahariya, the Tomb of the Sons of Ramses, and the sunken city of Alexandria (whose lighthouse was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World). Fagan concludes with a clear-eyed assessment of the impact of modern mass tourism on archaeological sites and artifacts.</p><p>Born in England and educated at Cambridge University, <b>Brian Fagan</b> is Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is internationally known for his popular books on archaeology. He lives in Santa Barbara, California.Fagan has written numerous archaeology books (e.g., <i>The Little Ice Age,</i> 2000), but his inaugural title from 1975 was out of print. This welcome revision recounts the encounter of all manner of people, from Herodotus to Howard Carter of Tutankhamen fame, with the pharaonic ruins of the Nile Valley. Modern interest in the imposing antiquity and scale of Giza, the Valley of the Kings, and the like dates from the French invasion of 1798, which included a scientific team--"the Enlightenment in action," in Fagan's words--to survey pyramids, temples, and tombs; its work provoked a rage in Europe for all things Egyptian. Some tackled the problem of unlocking hieroglyphics (achieved by Jean-Francois Champollion); others flexed their muscles to get the good stuff out of Egypt, like Giovanni Belzoni. By far the star attraction in Fagan's presentation, Belzoni was an ebulliently colorful character--a circus strongman in 1810 who chanced into the ancient Egypt craze and its accompanying lust for artifacts. That's how Egyptology began, and Fagan's history is a fine gateway to it. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Hundreds of thousands of people visit the house and gardens every year, enchanted by the vibrant-colored rooms restored just as they were in the house&#39;s heyday and decorated according to Monet&#39;s revolutionary views on color and light. As he moves through the house the author describes the mealtime rituals of the yellow dining room, the studio where Monet worked and entertained and the family activities that animated the blue room. She also opens the door to rooms not normally seen by the public - we catch a glimpse of private bedrooms and the cellar where wine was bottled and fruit preserved. This book is an invitation to visit the house on a summer&#39;s day in the 1890s to marvel at Monet&#39;s decorative vision and to experience some of the behind-the-scenes activities that underpinned the busy household.</p><p>Not only was Claude Monet (1840-1926) a leading member of the impressionist movement, he was also, as this charming book reveals, a master interior decorator. A virtual room-by-room guided tour of Monet&#39;s beautiful and much-visited home at Giverny, this volume offers a vivid impression of daily life in the beloved house where the artist lived for 40 years with his second wife and their eight children. With its pink stucco walls, green shutters, and brightly painted original furniture, the house reveals Monet&#39;s brilliance and innovation as a colorist, which transcended his light-infused canvases to inform his choice of hues for wall paint and furniture. Each room is explored in its own chapter with glorious color photos: the dining room, painted in two shades of yellow and adorned with Japanese prints; the blue-and-white-tiled kitchen; the blue drawing room; the studio as it appeared in its heyday. Enlarged paint swatches of Monet&#39;s unique color combinations accompany each chapter so that readers can reproduce them in their own homes.It is a summer's day in the late 1890s and Monet's house at Giverny is in its heyday. Outside, the pink stucco walls are punctuated by brilliant green shutters, and a new green balcony spans the length of the house. Inside, light streams through open windows, illuminating the vibrant, innovative colors Monet chose to color his rooms.<br><br>Here is a guided tour of the house where Monet lived for forty years with the woman who would become his second wife, Alice Hosched�, and their eight children. The original furniture, much of it painted in vivid hues, is here as well as appointments--china, linen, and small antique collectibles--authentic to what is known of Monet's lifestyle and the period.<br><br>Here is the famous dining room painted in two shades of yellow, embellished with Japanese prints and blue-and-white china. Here is the kitchen with its blue- and-white Rouen tiles and copper pots, the fabled studio where Monet not only painted but entertained his family and friends, the blue drawing room where the family gathered for games, the bedrooms and dressing rooms with their simple and elegant appointments, the foyers, the �picerie, even the cellar where wine and provisions were stored. Paint dabs showing the colors used in major rooms allow the reader to duplicate them in their own homes. <br><br>Heide Michels opens a door onto Monet's private world, giving us a vivid impression of the family's day-to-day routine, including family activities and mealtime rituals.

Petrol, manure, the mineral tang of salt. I&#x2019;m not that far from the sea, even here. My face is damp from the drizzle and the spray of tires on wet road. I&#x2019;m gripping the flowers in both hands now, like a bride. I chose hyacinths, though I wasn&#x2019;t sure&#x2014;blue ones only. Zach told me you should only ever have one color in a bunch. I&#x2019;ve wrapped the stems in wet paper towels and secured them in a small freezer bag. Either I made the paper too wet or there&#x2019;s a small hole in the bag, because water is seeping out. It&#x2019;s dripping down to my elbow.<br> <br>Over the road, I can see a slope of grass, a copse of blunt trees, the shadow of a hill behind. Above that, sky the color of dirty sheep, darker patches, a dribble of falling sun in the distance as the cold afternoon closes in. I am concentrating hard on all these things, because I know that somewhere in the corner of my vision, across the carriageway and away to the left, is the spot. But I&#x2019;m not going to look. Not yet.<br> <br>It is Valentine&#x2019;s Day, exactly a year since my husband&#x2019;s car crash, and I am two hundred miles from home beside an A-road in the middle of Cornwall. This trip is an ending or a beginning&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not quite sure which. It&#x2019;s time to move on. People tell me that all the time. I&#x2019;m trying to believe them.<br> <br>I pick my moment between the streaming cars and run. When I reach the far side, I look back at the lay-by where my Nissan Micra sits, rocking in the backdraft of the passing lorries. My dog watches me from the side window. I&#x2019;ve had a feeling since I parked that I&#x2019;m being shadowed. It&#x2019;s probably just the remoteness of the place; so many people driving past, no one else stopping. Or it&#x2019;s guilt&#x2014;guilt about all sorts of things, but mostly that I should have come sooner.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s conventional to visit the scene of a fatal accident, to leave flowers: all those lampposts decked with cellophane where poor cyclists have been killed. It&#x2019;s less usual to leave it this long. The night it happened, when PC Morrow came to the door, she would have brought me here straightaway. The patrol car was waiting. My sister Peggy stopped me. She told Morrow I needed to go home with her, not drive five hours to a wet, windswept Cornish roadside, to smoke and wreckage. It would be insane, she said. I could go another time. Zach was gone. There was nothing I could do.<br> <br>And it wasn&#x2019;t as if I didn&#x2019;t know what happened. Morrow, fresh from her Family Liaison training, went over it again and again. I understood about the lethal combination: the sea fog and the wet road, the sharp bend, the soft-top roof, the bottles of his favorite distillery-only whiskey on the passenger seat, the oil paints, the solvent-soaked rags in the boot, the thick trunk of the tree&#x2014;the disastrously placed tree.<br> <br>I kept putting it off. People understood. Cornwall was Zach&#x2019;s favorite place. He had a house down there that would need sorting out; they assumed I would get to it in my own time. But then, in the days and weeks that followed, I began to dread it&#x2014;seeing the emptiness of his bungalow, feeling the loss of him all over again.<br> <br>I feel a shiver up my back. The clouds are thickening. A gust whips my coat. I must hurry up, get this done, return to the car before it gets any darker. A motorbike, overtaking a lorry, howls. I step back. This thing that had seemed so necessary when I was two hundred miles away has started to feel mad, reckless.<br> <br>I pick my way along the narrow crumbling shoulder between the white line and the barrier. One foot in front of the other. That&#x2019;s how you get through&#x2014;everyone tells you that. One step at a time. I focus as hard as I can on the littered ground: a hamburger wrapper, smeared with ketchup; a used condom, oddly bright in the polluted grass. A polystyrene cup, lodged in the barrier, flips and flaps every time a car passes. As I near the bend, a horn blares&#x2014;in anxious warning maybe, or perhaps in astonishment at the madwoman in the road with her hands full of flowers.<br> <br>When I get there, I&#x2019;ll put the hyacinths down flat at the base. Is that right? Or do they need to be higher? Perhaps I should have thought more about it, brought Scotch tape. Zach would know&#x2014;though he&#x2019;d hate me for coming. He would take it as an insult, not a tribute. He hated sentimentality. He didn&#x2019;t even like anniversaries. He&#x2019;d think I was giving in to clich�, or to the advice of others. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;ve you been listening to, Lizzie Carter?&#x201d;<br> <br>I can sense the tree&#x2019;s form now, its arms veined against the gray sky. I reach the frayed slash in the hedgerow. Pale green shoots on the tip of each twig. It&#x2019;s callous, the way this hawthorn has regenerated, the way it has bounced back. I glance behind once more and then I hoist myself over the crash barrier, and there it is: the tree, an oak, oddly dignified despite the deep gash in its gnarled bark.<br> <br>Zach&#x2019;s tree. I reach out to touch it, to feel the rough grooves of the bark with my fingers. I rest my head against it. My eyes fill.<br> <br>My friend Jane didn&#x2019;t think I should have come on my own today. I made her laugh to prove I could cope. I put on a funny voice and talked about my &#x201c;ceremonial visit,&#x201d; my &#x201c;ritual deposit of floral tribute&#x201d;&#x2014;phrases from the self-help book my sister gave me. I didn&#x2019;t tell her the whole truth&#x2014;how complicated my grief is, how murky, how, more than anything, this is about laying ghosts.<br> <br>Is all grief so confused, or is it just my particular misshapen form of it? There are days I accept his death and I move through the world as if underwater. Ordinary tasks, like filling the dishwasher, or sending off bills, feel brutal and empty. I resent the pigeons nesting outside the bedroom window, the schoolkids at the start of the term in their new uniform. I can be sideswiped by the smallest of things. I saw a white bike helmet on the head of a man cycling down Northcote Road last week and a wave hit me with such strength, my knees buckled. I had to crouch for a bit on the pavement outside Capstick Sports. Other days, I forget. I am almost carefree, relieved, and then I am overcome by feelings of such intense shame I don&#x2019;t know where to put myself. I succumb to lethargy and depression. I put things off.<br> <br>Standing here, I feel close to him in a pure way. This was the point of coming. His death feels real for the first time. I must let him go, hard as it is, because, despite everything, he was the love of my life. Peggy is right. He was the man I have spent most of my life loving&#x2014;the most minutes, the most hours, the most days, the most time. I close my eyes, blink my tears away, and wonder if I can now let my restless thoughts lie.<br> <br>Something crackles beneath my foot, and I look down.<br> <br>Propped against the roots is a bouquet of flowers. Casablanca lilies, formally wrapped in cellophane, secured with a large purple ribbon.<br> <br>I step back. Another accident in the same place: that&#x2019;s my first thought. A black spot. The curve of the road, and the unfortunate lay of the land. Another night of fog, perhaps. More rain.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m disconcerted. I don&#x2019;t know where to put my hyacinths. The lilies look so professional and important. I stand there, wondering what to do. I&#x2019;m not sure Zach, despite his contempt, would want to share. So it&#x2019;s a moment before I even see the note. It&#x2019;s white. Someone has drawn a large heart with a name&#x2014;I tilt my head sideways: X&nbsp;E&nbsp;N&nbsp;I&nbsp;A&#x2014;spelled out around it. And at the top, in big black letters, it reads: FOR ZACH.<br> <br>And for a moment, honestly, I think: what a coincidence. Someone else called Zach has crashed and died here. Did they, to use PC Morrow&#x2019;s verb, &#x201c;fireball&#x201d; too?<br> <br>And then, as the truth settles, I lay the flowers down meekly, on the ground. I rise and, in a trance, pass again through the gap in the hedge, over the crash barrier, and I&#x2019;m heading along the road the way I came, empty-handed, head down. It&#x2019;s only when I look up that I see another car&#x2014;a silver SUV, right up close behind the Micra, tight against its bumper.<br> <br>A knot begins to press at the top of my spine. I try to run back across the road, but my legs feel weighted, drugged. Cars are coming from behind. A horn blares. My skirt is flapping, trails of scarf whip around my face. Brakes squeal, another horn sounds. A rush of air and spray.<br> <br>I fumble at the car door, hurl myself into the seat, greeted by the dog, his wiry lurcher body, licking and wriggling and trying to get away from me all at the same time. In the rearview mirror I watch the SUV pull out, catch the hunched form of the driver wrestling the wheel. He must have stopped to check directions, or take a call. Mustn&#x2019;t he?<br> <br>Seen in the mirror, my eyes are red-rimmed. A scratch has appeared across my cheek. I rub the top of Howard&#x2019;s head, roll my fingers under his collar and dig them into the folds around his neck. I am trying not to cry.<br> <br>A hand-drawn heart. Xenia. He never mentioned a Xenia.<br> <br>I feel a sharp ache of jealousy, mixed with the old longing, but I am aware also for the first time of its opposite: a slipping of responsibility. Someone else loved him. I have a taste at the back of my throat, clean and metallic, and, despite everything, I realize it&#x2019;s relief.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>The Internet played Cupid. I like to be up front about that. My sister Peggy, who cares more about appearances than I do, decided early on that we shouldn&#x2019;t. Pretend it began with a chance encounter at the supermarket. &#x201c;Tell people you bumped into each other by the fresh fruit,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;reaching for the same Fairtrade pineapple or what have you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or at the ready-made meals for one,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Picking over the Mr. Brains Pork Fingers,&#x201d; said Zach. &#x201c;Or what have you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was wary at first. I couldn&#x2019;t think what he saw in me. But at that moment, in Peggy&#x2019;s kitchen, watching him charm my sister, the &#x201c;what have you&#x201d; already a private joke between us, I let myself fall in love.<br> <br>Jane, happily married to her childhood sweetheart, had encouraged me to sign up. Since we first met at sixth form college, apart from a brief period in my twenties she had never known me not single. We worked at the same school&#x2014;it was Jane who put me forward for the job in the library&#x2014;and she nagged every break time. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like it used to be,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;No stigma. You just need to pick a website attached to a broadsheet news�paper. You&#x2019;ll get the right kind of person there. You know&#x201d;&#x2014;she made a rolling gesture with her hands, spinning delicacy from �snobbery&#x2014;&#x201c;educated.&#x201d; Jane went to university and sometimes forgets that I didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>For my profile, I wanted to write: dowdy librarian, few qualifications, main carer for parent with dementia, very little romantic experience. Jane had other ideas. My friends describe me as an outgoing and fun-loving world traveler, she wrote, batting me away from the screen. Equally comfortable in jeans and a little black dress.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even own a black dress.&#x201d;<br> <br>She tutted dismissively. &#x201c;Who cares?&#x201d;<br> <br>Zach was my sixth date. An artist, he lived in Brighton, way beyond my prescribed five-mile radius, so I almost didn&#x2019;t meet him. On the phone, he suggested a walk. They tell you to avoid that sort of interaction; better to meet in a public place. He had already showed himself a rule breaker. The others had engaged in a series of emails in which personality-revealing issues were debated&#x2014;country life versus town, sexual excitement versus companionship. He just asked if he could ring me. Plus he used his real name right away, not &#x201c;Lookin&#x2019;forluv_007,&#x201d; say, but Zach Hopkins.<br> <br>In his photograph he wasn&#x2019;t skiing, or braced in front of a vintage car. He didn&#x2019;t have his arms around a German shepherd. His picture was black-and-white, out of focus, shot at a low speed, taken from above, his mouth half open, a slight frown, the puzzled concentration of a person deciphering a crossword. The picture looked artless, picked at random, though as I would find out, nothing was ever artless or random with Zach.<br> <br>I said yes to the walk. I don&#x2019;t think I hesitated. His low, steady voice; his air, very slightly ironic, of cutting to the chase. Already I was enthralled, knocked off course by his certainty.<br> <br>He caught the train from Brighton to Clapham Junction, and I waited for him nervously outside the new entrance at the top. It was November, overcast, with a light chill in the air&#x2014;but it wasn&#x2019;t cold. He was wearing a Russian fur hat and a heavy coat over a baggy linen suit. As we set off toward the common, me tugging at Howard to stop him from leaping up at the hat, he told me it had taken a long time to choose his outfit. &#x201c;I wanted to impress you with my natural sophistication. You are, after all, a world traveler.&#x201d; He gave a small bow. &#x201c;I was also pursuing a note of eccentricity, an oddity about which we could reminisce. I wanted us to be able to look back and say, &#x2018;Remember that fur hat you wore on our first date. What were you thinking?&#x2019; With the added advantage&#x201d;&#x2014;he paused to strike a pose&#x2014;&#x201c;I thought the trench made me appear more muscular.&#x201d;<br> <br>I found it hard to talk because I was so overwhelmed by how handsome he was. The breadth of his shoulders, the blue intensity of his eyes, the stooped height of him. Halfway through my previous date, a coffee in Starbucks with Mr.NiceGuy, a telecoms engineer from Crystal Palace, I had caught sight of the two of us in a mirror. Our rounded shoulders, our bland and yet vulnerable expressions. We looked like two turtles without their shells. I couldn&#x2019;t think what Zach was doing here. Or why he would waste any time with me. The way he spoke, too, the self-conscious theatricality and the slight nervousness behind it, the accelerated intimacy that might have been ironic or might not. He was the opposite of shell-less turtle, the opposite of bland.<br> <br>&#x201c;You seem quite muscular to me,&#x201d; I said eventually.<br> <br>We hadn&#x2019;t even walked as far as the traffic lights across the South Circular when he reached for my hand, stuffing it inside his pocket along with his own.<br> <br>I remember that more than anything&#x2014;the rough warmth of his fingers, the dryness I was to discover came from oil paint and white spirit, the cracks across his palm. I remember that more than his volubility, or the heavy overcoat, or the ridiculous hat. He didn&#x2019;t told my hand stiffly, either. He rubbed it as we walked, massaging it back and forth with his thumb, as if testing the flesh.<br> <br>Later, when I knew more about him, when he&#x2019;d explained about his childhood, the problems he had with trust, when he had gazed so deeply into my eyes I felt as if my insides were melting, he told me it wasn&#x2019;t loneliness that had led him to the Internet. In the normal run of things, he met single women all the time. He was in search of a new beginning, that was all. He just wanted to start again.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>I turn the key in the ignition and pull out. The traffic is heavy. It&#x2019;s the dull end of a Saturday afternoon, locals are heading away from a soccer match. Dusk is beginning to roll out across the fields. I still have twenty miles to drive from here and I promised Jane, who knows how much I am dreading opening the door to Zach&#x2019;s holiday house, that I would reach it before dark.<br> <br>I keep going the long way&#x2014;the Bodmin bypass and the main road into Wadebridge; two sides of a triangle. It&#x2019;s the route Zach used to take to Gulls before he discovered the shortcut. A year ago, according to Morrow&#x2019;s analysis, Zach missed the junction and turned round at the next roundabout.

Launched in 1922, the<br>Cambridge-based company quickly moved to the forefront of innovation in the electronics industry. During World War II, thousands of Raytheon workers contributed to the war effort, supplying eighty percent of the magnetron tubes (vital components for U.S. and British radars), developing miniature tubes for the crucial proximity fuse in antiaircraft shells, and providing entire radar systems. Although government contracts slowed after World War II, Raytheon continued to develop military components, including leading-edge radars and missiles for America&#x2019;s defenses in the Cold War, but it also began to offer a host of civilian products: the famous RadaRange (the world&#x2019;s first microwave oven), televisions, marine radars, transistors, miniature hearing aids, and medical equipment.</p><p>Alan R. Earls, a technology and business writer, has covered high-technology stories since the early 1980s. Robert E.

Instead, they often took over roles on the &#x201c;home front&#x201d; traditionally reserved for men. <br><br>The role of women in support of national war efforts is the focus of an exhibit throughout the November at the T. Ross Kelly Family Gallery of the Watertown Free Library. Titled, &#x201c;Yes They Can!,&#x201d; the exhibit of historic images showcases the lives and times of the Women of Watertown Arsenal, and other local employers, through a series of photographs selected by Alan R. Earls, from his Arcadia Publishing photo-history books, &#x201c;Watertown Arsenal and Raytheon: the First 60 Years.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Although the photographers are anonymous, many of the images are reminiscent of those crafted by famed photographer Lewis W. Hines,&#x201d; said Earls. Those photos capture the hard work and occasional triumphs of daily life in an industrial setting traditionally dominated by men and primarily span the period of World War I and World War II.<br><br>Although women were employed by the Arsenal as far back as the American Civil War &#x2015; they represented more than 10 percent of the 800 employees at the time, according to historical records &#x2015; and many more worked during World War I, it was in the Second World War, the age of Rosie the Riveter, that their numbers and influence really grew &#x2015; with total employment reaching into the thousands.<br><br>And, in a nod to the future, said Earls, &#x201c;The photos from the Second World War show a more confident and diverse workforce, with women and men of all races working together in many roles.&#x201d;<br><br>Nationally, according to the Rosie the Riveter National Historical Site in Richmond, Calif., some 6 million women worked in defense industries and support services during World War II, including shipyards, steel mills, foundries, lumber mills, warehouses, offices, hospitals and daycare centers.<br><br>The Watertown Arsenal was operational from 1816 to 1967, initially serving primarily as a regional storage facility for military supplies. By the time of the Civil War, however, the arsenal had begun its transformation into a major facility for the design, development and manufacture of military products, particularly artillery.<br><br>Although the Arsenal faded from view after its 1967 closure, it didn&#x2019;t disappear. Army research activities occupied a section of the property until the late 1980s, for example, at the smaller research organizations such as the Army Materials and Mechanics Research Center. Many of the buildings associated with the Arsenal have gone on to serve new and important functions as the Arsenal Mall, offices and research spaces.<br><br>The women and the Arsenal may be gone, noted Earls, paraphrasing an inscription at the Rosie the Riveter historical site, &#x201c;However, we should remember that, without women, there might have been no victory in 1945.&#x201d; <br><br>The exhibit area is on the second floor of the library, 123 Main St., and admission is free.

Arrestingly beautiful, quick-witted, and ultimately vulnerable, Leigh has drawn the attention of many biographers. Yet with the veil of rumors and complex mythology that has grown around her name, most biographies, invariably Hollywood filmographies, have been inaccurate and incomplete. Author Higo Vickers approaches the actress as a human being--not as an entertainment property--and accords her the same detailed research that earned him high critical praise for his biography of Cecil Beaton.</p><p>Vivien Leigh's life was packed with the stuff of compelling biography: beauty, talent, glamour, wit, intelligence, romance, madness. Vickers ( Cecil Beaton ), however, has gone no further in his re-creation than to organize his notes into chapters and let the tidbits speak for themselves. The biography is overstuffed with the most tangential minutiae, a cornucopia of irrelevant details and unrelated anecdotes. Fugitive quotations are dropped into paragraphs with no effort made to relate them to the surrounding information. The material is given equal weight, with nothing to anchor or tie facts together into a cohesive narrative. This is a monumentally disappointing book about one of our era's most exciting actresses.

Shirer sifted through the massive self-documentation of the Third Reich, to create a monumental study that has been widely acclaimed as the definitive record of one of the most frightening chapters in the history of mankind--now in a special 30th anniversary edition.<br>"One of the most important works of history of our time."<br>THE NEW YORK TIMES</p><p>William L. Shirer's THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH is a monumental study of the 20th Century's most frightening moments. Now, 53 years after the end of World War II, it may seem incredible that our most valued institutions, and way of life, were threatened by the menace that Hitler and the Third Reich represented. Shirer's description of events and the cast of characters who played such pivotal roles in defining the course Europe was to take is unforgettable.<br><br>Benefiting from his many years as a reporter, and thus a personal observer of the rise of Nazi Germany, and availing himself of some of the 485 tons of documents from the German Foreign Office, captured by the First Army, as well as countless other diaries, phone transcriptions, and other written records, meticulously kept at every level by the Germans, Shirer has put together a brutally objective account of how Hitler wrested political control of Germany, and planned and executed his 6 year quest to dominate the world, only at the end, to see Germany go down in flames.<br><br>The combination of personal recollection and amassing of historical evidence distinguishes this book as one of the great historical works of any time. For instance, he recounts that, from his apartment in Plosslgasse, in Vienna, he personally witnessed how perhaps half of Vienna's 180,000 Jews bargained their way to freedom in 1938.<br><br>Shirer explains that Hitler believed that France and England were too weak to pose much of a threat to his ambitions to subjugate Czechoslovakia, and later Poland. The momentary relief of Russia as a threat to his domination of Europe as a result of the flurry of diplomatic activity that proceeded his invasion of Poland is fascinating. There is no relief, throughout his narrative, of the brutality of Hitler and such a large contingent of Germans who populate this narrative.<br><br>Although 1600 pages long, this is such a richly rewarding experience for anyone who wants to come to grips with the mysterious question as to how this menace to civilization ever came into being, much less was sustained for as long as it was. The answer, unfortunately, is that most of Germany, for a whole host of reasons, embraced Nazism and the fanaticism that Hitler engendered.<br><br>For another book that deals with this problem, why so much of Germany lent its support to Hitler, I heartily recommend HITLER'S WILLING EXECUTIONER'S, by Daniel Goldhagen, published by Vintage Books. Although filled with perhaps more statistical details then the non-professional historian would need, this book helps to adumbrate the themes in Shirer's great book.<br><br>George Davidson, Director of Production, The Ballantine Publishing Group<b>Ron Rosenbaum </b>is the bestselling author of <i>Explaining Hitler </i>and <i>The Shakespeare Wars </i>and has written or edited six<i> </i>other books.

Lively, varied, original and full of humor, Mola art has an astonishing relationship with tradition but in many ways looks contemporary and is prized by museums and private collectors throughout the world. The lavish images reveal the setting, lifestyle, gestures and beauty of the Kuna women practising their art. French anthropologist Claude L�vi-Strauss has praised Michel Perrin's brilliant demonstration of the links between Mola textile art and Kuna ritual and body decoration. Perrin depicts the significant events that took place during his field research and shares with us his discussions with the Kuna women and their opinions about techniques and aesthetics.

The book begins with Pauline&#39;s first overwhelming impressions of color, people and places. In search of material, making friends on her way, she discovers the Rajasthani cities, is invited to a royal wedding and finds artisans devoted to their centuries-old crafts. After some time, a longing for quiet draws her to the countryside, and the second half of the book focuses on the villages and a rhythm of life which has not changed much over the centuries. The fourteen chapters of the book are each introduced by two pages of stories and descriptions by Pauline to explain, in a personal way, the following pages of photographs. The text is limited to her impressions, as the book is meant to be essentially a visual experience. With her artistic background, an upbringing in international surroundings, a curious and eclectic mind, a keen photographer&#39;s eye and a great sensitivity for detail and atmosphere, Pauline is perfectly equipped to bring her own view of Rajasthan to the public in this informed and evocative manner.</p><p>Pauline van Lynden has a master&#39;s degree in political science from the University of Louvain, Belgium, and studied bookbinding at the Ecole de la Cambre in Brussels, which she practiced and taught for many years. Two subsequent years at art school in Holland, with a focus on drawing and painting, and repeated trips to India since 1988 led to a collection of notes, pictures and photographs out of which came this, her first book, on Rajasthan.</p><h2>Moonfire</h2><p>Maggie Chamberlin, an American actess, travels all the way to Australia in 1887 on the promises of a scoundrel and encounters Reeve McKenna, an Irishman who has become one of the richest men in Australia.

Jackie moved and the plane moved. As though the body of the plane were a second skin to her, she could move the airplane as easily as she moved her arm or her leg. Smiling, she dipped one wing downward to look at the beautiful high mountain desert of Colorado.<br><br>At first she didn't believe what she saw. Sitting in the middle of nowhere, miles from the nearest road, was a car. Thinking that the vehicle had been abandoned, she turned her plane, dipping the wings, turning on a dime, to backtrack to have a second look. The car hadn't been there yesterday, so perhaps someone needed help.<br><br>She swooped down as low as she dared, not that the pi�ion trees, rarely over twenty feet tall, were going to interfere with the height she needed to stay aloft. As she came back for a second pass she saw a man stand up from the shade of the car and raise his arm in greeting. Smiling, she turned her plane back toward her home base. He was all right, then, and as soon as she landed at her airstrip in Eternity, she'd call the sheriff to send the stranded traveler some help.<br><br>She was chuckling to herself. Travelers often were stranded in Colorado. They looked at the flat landscape off the side of the road and decided to see nature up close. But they didn't take into consideration the thorns as large as a man's little finger and rocks whose sharpness had not been worn away by heavy yearly rainfall.<br><br>Maybe it was because she was laughing and not watching what she was doing that she didn't see the bird, as big as a lamb, that flew straight into her propeller. She doubted that she could have avoided hitting it, but she would have tried. As it was, everything happened very quickly. One minute she was flying toward home and the next minute there were feathers and blood all over her goggles and the plane was going down.<br><br>Jackie was a good pilot, one of the best in America. She'd certainly had a great deal of training, having received her license at eighteen years of age, and now, at thirty-eight, she was an old hand. But coping with this bird took all of her knowledge and skill. As the engine began to sputter, she knew she was going to have to do a dead-stick landing, a landing without power. Quickly, tearing off her goggles so she could see, she looked about for a place to set it down. She needed a wide, long clearing, someplace free of trees and rocks that could tear the wings off the plane.<br><br>The old road to the ghost town of Eternity offered the only possibility. She didn't know what had grown or rolled across the road in the many years that it hadn't been used, but she had no other choice. Within the flash of an eye, she lined up the nose to the "runway" and started down. There was a boulder blocking the road -- it had probably rolled down during the spring thaw -- and she was praying to stop the plane before she hit the enormous rock.<br><br>Luck wasn't with her, for she plowed into the rock. As she crashed, she could hear the sickening crunch of her propeller being destroyed. She didn't think anymore. Her head flew forward, hitting the stick; she was out cold.<br><br>The next thing Jackie knew, she was being held in a pair of very strong, masculine arms and carried away from the plane. "Are you my rescuing knight?" she asked dreamily. She could feel something warm running down her face. When she put up her hand to wipe it away, she thought she saw blood, but her eyes weren't functioning properly and the daylight was fading fast.<br><br>"Am I badly hurt?" she asked, knowing the man wouldn't tell her the truth. She'd seen a couple of men mangled in airplane wrecks, and as they lay dying everyone had reassured them that tomorrow they'd be fine.<br><br>"I don't think so," the man said. "I think you just bumped your head, cracked it a bit."<br><br>"Oh, well, then, I'll be okay. Nobody's head is harder than mine." He was still carrying her, but her weight didn't seem to bother him at all. As best she could, considering how dizzy she felt, she pulled her head back to look at him. In the fading light he looked great, but then, Jackie reminded herself, she'd just cracked her skull in a plane wreck. For all she knew, he had three heads and six eyes. No one could be so lucky as to crash in the middle of acres of nothing and find a handsome man to rescue her.<br><br>"Who are you?" she asked thickly, because all of a sudden she felt very sleepy.<br><br>"William Montgomery," he answered.<br><br>"A Montgomery from Chandler?" When he said yes, Jackie snuggled against his wide, broad chest and sighed happily. At least she didn't have to worry about his intentions. If he was a Chandler Montgomery then he was honorable and fair and would never take advantage of the situation; Montgomerys were as honest and trustworthy as the day was long.<br><br>More's the pity, she thought.<br><br>When they were some distance from the plane, near his car, which she could just make out in the dim light, he gently set her on the ground. Cupping her chin in his hand, he looked into her eyes. "I want you to stay here and wait for me. I'm going to get some blankets from the car, then build a fire. When you don't show up at the airfield, will anyone come looking for you?"<br><br>"No," she whispered. She liked his voice, liked the air of authority in it. He made her feel as though he'd take care of everything, including her.<br><br>"I was planning to spend the night out here, so no one will look for me either," he said. "While I'm gone, I want you to stay awake, do you hear me? If your head is concussed and you go to sleep, you might not wake up again. Understand?"<br><br>Dreamily, Jackie nodded and watched him walk away. Very good looking man, she thought as she lay down on the ground and promptly went to sleep.<br><br>Mere seconds later he was shaking her. "Jackie! Jacqueline!" he said over and over until she reluctantly opened her eyes and looked up at him.<br><br>"How do you know my name?" she asked. "Have we met before? I've met so many Montgomerys that I can't keep them straight. Bill, did you say your name was?"<br><br>"William," he said firmly, "and, yes, we've met before, but I'm sure you wouldn't remember. It wasn't a significant meeting."<br><br>"'Significant meeting,'" she said, closing her eyes again, but William sat her up, draped a blanket around her shoulders, then rubbed her hands.<br><br>"Stay awake, Jackie," he said, and she recognized it for the order it was. "Stay awake and talk to me. Tell me about Charley."<br><br>At the mention of her late husband, she stopped smiling. "Charley died two years ago."<br><br>William was trying to collect wood and watch her at the same time. The light was fading quickly, and he had difficulty seeing the pieces of cholla on the ground, as well as the deadfall. He had met her husband many times, and he'd liked him very much: a big, robust gray-haired man who laughed a lot, talked a lot, drank a lot, and could fly anything that could be flown.<br><br>Now, looking at her, drowsy, he knew he needed to warm her up, get some food inside her, and make her stay awake.<br><br>Right now she was in a state of shock, and that, combined with her injury, might keep her from seeing another dawn.<br><br>"Jackie!" he said sharply. "What's the biggest lie you ever told?"<br><br>"I don't lie," she said dreamily. "Can't keep them straight. Always get caught."<br><br>"Sure you lie. Everybody lies. You tell a woman her hat is nice when it's hideous. I didn't ask you if you had lied or not; I just want to know what your biggest lie was." He was stacking up what wood he could find as he questioned her, his voice loud; he couldn't let her sleep.<br><br>"I used to lie to my mother about where I was."<br><br>"You can do better than that."<br><br>When she spoke, her voice was so soft he could barely hear her. "I told Charley I loved him."<br><br>"And you didn't love him?" William encouraged her to talk as he dropped a pile of wood near her feet.<br><br>"Not at first. He was older than me, twenty-one years older, and at first I thought of him as a father. I used to skip school and spend the afternoons with him and the airplanes. I loved planes from the first moment I saw them."<br><br>"So you married Charley to get near the planes."<br><br>"Yes," she said, her voice heavy with guilt. She sat upright and put her hand to her bloody head, but William brushed her hand away and turned her face up toward his as he used his handkerchief to wipe away the blood.<br><br>After he'd reassured himself and her that the cut on the side of her head was minor, he said, "Go on. When did you realize that you loved him?"<br><br>"I didn't think about it one way or another until after we'd been married about five years. Charley's plane was lost in a snowstorm, and when I thought I might never see him again, I found out how much I loved him."<br><br>After a moment of silence she looked at him as he bent over the wood he was trying to coax into a fire. "What about you?"<br><br>"I didn't once tell Charley I loved him."<br><br>Jackie smiled. "No, what's the biggest lie you ever told?"<br><br>"I told my father it wasn't me who dented the fender of the car."<br><br>"Mmm," said Jackie, becoming a little more alert. "That's not a very horrible lie. Can't you come up with something better?"<br><br>"I told my mother I wasn't the one who'd eaten the whole strawberry pie. I told my brother that my sister had broken his slingshot. I told -- "<br><br>"Okay, okay," Jackie said, laughing. "I get the picture. You're a consummate liar. All right, I have one for you. What's the worst thing a woman can say to a man?"<br><br>William didn't hesitate. "'Which silver pattern do you like best?'"<br><br>Jackie grinned. She was beginning to like this man, and her overwhelming sleepiness was starting to subside. <br><br>"What's the worst thing a man can say to a woman?" he asked.<br><br>Jackie was as quick to answer as he had been. "When you're shopping and the man says, 'Just exactly what is it you're looking for?'"<br><br>Chuckling, he walked the few feet to his car to open the door and remove camping gear. "What's the nicest thing a man can say to a woman?"<br><br>"I love you. That is, if he means it. If he doesn't mean it, then he should be horsewhipped for saying it. And you? What's the nicest thing for you?"<br><br>"Yes," he said.<br><br>"Yes what?"<br><br>"Yes is the very best thing a woman can say to a man."<br><br>Jackie laughed. "To any question? No matter what she's asked, it's what you most want to hear?"<br><br>"It would be rather nice to hear yes from a woman's lips, at least now and then."<br><br>"Oh, come on, a man who looks like you has never heard a woman say yes to whatever you asked her?"<br><br>His arms full of blankets and canteens and a basket of food, he grinned at her. "One or two, but no more."<br><br>"Okay, it's my turn. What's the kindest thing you ever did for someone and didn't tell anyone about?"<br><br>"I guess that would have to be adding a wing to the hospital in Denver. I sent the money anonymously."<br><br>"Oh, my," she said, remembering how rich the Montgomerys were.<br><br>"And you?"<br><br>Jackie began to laugh. "Charley and I had been married for about four years, and with Charley you never stayed in one place long enough to learn your neighbors' names, much less put down roots. But that year we had rented a small house that had a very nice kitchen in it, and I decided to cook him a marvelous Thanksgiving dinner. I talked about nothing else but that dinner for two weeks. I planned and shopped, and on Thanksgiving Day I got up at four A.M. and got the turkey ready. Charley left the house about noon, but he promised he'd be back by five when everything would be ready to serve. He was going to bring some of the other pilots from the airfield, and it was going to be a party. Five o'clock came and there was no Charley. Six came and went, then seven. At midnight I fell asleep, but I was so angry that I slept in a rigid knot. The next morning there was Charley, snoring away on the sofa, and there was my beautiful Thanksgiving dinner in ruins. You know what I did?"<br><br>"I'm surprised Charley lived after that."<br><br>"I shouldn't have let him live, but I figured the worst thing I could do was not let him have any of my dinner. I bundled everything up in burlap bags, went to the airfield, took up Charley's plane and flew into the mountains -- we were in West Virginia then, so it was the Smokies -- where I saw a dilapidated old shack perched on the side of a hill, a measly little trickle of smoke coming out of the chimney. I dropped the bags practically on the front porch."<br><br>She pulled her knees up to her chest and sighed. "Until now I never told anyone about that. Later I heard that the family said an angel had dropped food from heaven."<br><br>He had the fire going now, and he smiled at her over it. "I like that story. What did Charley say when he got no turkey?"<br><br>She shrugged. "Charley was happy if he had turkey and happy if he had beans. When it came to food, Charley was into quantity, not quality." She looked up at him. "What's the worst thing that's happened to you?"<br><br>William answered without thinking. "Being born rich."<br><br>Jackie gave a low whistle. "You'd think that was the <i>best</i> thing that had happened to you."<br><br>"It is. It's the best and the worst."<br><br>"I think I can see that." She was thinking about this as William poured water from a canteen onto a handkerchief and, with his hand cupping her chin, began to clean the wound on the side of her head.<br><br>"What's your deepest, darkest secret, something that you've never told anyone?" he asked.<br><br>"It wouldn't be a secret if I told."<br><br>"Do you think I'd tell anyone?"<br><br>She turned her head and looked up at him, at the shadows the firelight cast across his handsome face: dark hair, dark eyes, dark skin, that long Montgomery nose. Maybe it was the unusual circumstances, the dark night surrounding them, the fire at the center, but she felt close to him. "I kissed another man while I was married to Charley," she whispered.<br><br>"That's all?"<br><br>"That's pretty bad in my book. What about you?"<br><br>"I backed out on a contract."<br><br>"Was that really bad? If you changed your mind..."<br><br>"It was a breach of promise, and <i>she</i> thought it was <i>very</i> bad."<br><br>"Ah, I see," Jackie said, smiling as she wrapped her arms around her knees. "What's your favorite food?"<br><br>"Ice cream."<br><br>She laughed. "Mine too. Favorite color."<br><br>"Blue. Yours?"<br><br>She looked up at him. "Blue."<br><br>He came to sit by her, dusting off his hands. When Jackie shivered in the cool mountain air, he put his arm around her shoulders, as naturally as breathing, and pulled her head to his chest. "Do you mind?"<br><br>Jackie couldn't even speak. It felt so good to touch another human being. Charley had always been cuddly and affectionate, and she had often sat on his lap, snuggling in his arms, while he read some airplane magazine aloud to her.<br><br>She didn't realize she was drifting off to sleep until his voice jolted her awake.<br><br>"What's the biggest regret in your life?" he asked sharply.<br><br>"That I wasn't born with a few Mae West curves," she answered quickly. She used to whine to Charley that the guys treated her like one of them because she looked like them: an angular face, with a square jaw, broad shoulders, straight hips, and long legs.<br><br>"You are joking, aren't you?" William said, his voice full of disbelief. "You're one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. I can't tell you how many times I've stopped dead in my tracks as I watched you walk down the streets of Chandler."</p><h2>The Silver Mage</h2><p>The fifteenth and final novel in the celebrated Deverry series, an epic fantasy rooted in Celtic mythology that intricately interweaves human and elven history over several hundred years. Spurred on by the priestesses of the false goddess Alshandra, the Horsekin hordes are massing on the northern border of Prince Dar&#39;s holdings. Their leaders believe that the rich grasslands of the prince&#39;s domain belong to them by divine right, no matter whom they must destroy to claim them. But Dar has powerful allies on his side, including the dragon Arzosah, who has hated the Horsekin for hundreds of years. She will vow to take a revenge worse than anything the Horsekin and their priestesses could possibly foresee. The prince&#39;s most powerful ally, however, is the one the Horsekin refuse to understand: the deep magic of the dweomer, as wielded by the band of sorcerers sworn to protect him, and especially by the elven master of magic, Dallandra, the silver mage.</p><p>Katharine Kerr was born in Ohio, and moved to San Francisco Bay Area in 1962, where she has lived ever since.

He grew up in Birmingham, England, on a diet of horror movies and post-apocalyptic fiction. He started his career working at a bank, but then decided to write the kind of fiction he loved. His first novel, <i>Straight to You</i>, had what Moody calls &#x201c;microscopic sales,&#x201d; and so when he wrote Autumn, he decided to publish it online. The book became a sensation and has been downloaded by half a million readers. He started his own publishing company, Infected Books. He lives in Britain with his wife and a houseful of daughters, which may explain his preoccupation with Armageddon.<p>TODAY</p><p></p><p>The two men skulked silently through the filthy streets like starving rats, skin deathly pale, eyes blinking wide, both of them looking from side to side in constant, never-ending fear of attack. They ran frantically through the collapsed ruins at the edge of the town, arms overloaded with the food they&#x2019;d unexpectedly managed to scavenge, fear and adrenaline driving them on, temporarily masking their physical pain. Their bodies were wrecked: exhausted and underfed. It was the first time either of them had been out in the open in more than two weeks but, as the physically strongest members of the last remaining group of Unchanged in the area, this was something they&#x2019;d had no choice but to do. Including the straggler who&#x2019;d found them a few days back, there were only thirteen of them left now. Both Fisher and Winston knew that none of them would last much longer if they didn&#x2019;t have food.<br><br>Fisher froze. &#x201c;Up ahead. Top of the road. Two hundred metres.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winston grabbed his arm and pulled him back against the wall of the nearest building. He watched the Hater in the distance. Was it alone or part of a pack? His eyes were failing and it was hard to tell anything from here, but it looked like a young boy, probably one of those feral kids like the one that had killed his dad last summer. It paused on the dotted white line in the middle of the road, sniffing at the air like a hunting animal trying to catch a scent. Winston forced himself to remain completely motionless and prayed that Fisher would do the same. Even the slightest movement or noise might give them away and that&#x2019;d be it &#x2013; months of constantly struggling to survive ended in a heartbeat (maybe that wouldn&#x2019;t be such a bad thing, he thought). He watched the figure up ahead as it began to move again, very slowly at first, then sprinting away at speed when something in the distance caught its eye. Winston didn&#x2019;t move until he was completely sure it had gone. In those unbearably long moments, he asked himself again (as he did at least once every hour) why he was even bothering to try and stay alive? Why not just give up and get it over with? A few seconds of agony and it would all be over and he could stop at last. The fear of death had always been enough to keep driving him on until now, but life was rapidly losing its appeal. Imagine the relief, he thought. No more running. No more hiding. No more crying. No more sitting in silence in the dark with the others, freezing cold, doubled-up with hunger pains, feeling himself draining away, just waiting for the inevitable . . .</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;re clear,&#x201d; Fisher said, his voice just a whisper against the icy wind. Winston pushed himself away from the wall and ran forward again, just managing to keep his balance as he tripped down the kerb, narrowly avoiding the crumbling edge of a huge, egg-shaped crater in the road where the skeletal body of someone who had once been like him lay face down in several inches of dirty rainwater.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another few minutes of breathless, stop-start running and hiding, and they were almost there. Winston dropped the supplies he&#x2019;d been carrying in front of the wooden fence then quickly lifted up the third panel along from the right, his fingers numb with cold. Fisher hurriedly climbed through the gap then reached back for the tins and boxes they&#x2019;d collected. He stood up again and took the weight of the panel so the other man could follow him through. Winston paused to snatch up a can of fruit that Fisher had missed, and to check they hadn&#x2019;t been seen. Behind them, everything appeared reassuringly silent and still. A flurry of grey, ash-like snow drifted down, each flake settling on the ground for just a fraction of a second before melting away to nothing. The remains of the town where he used to live looked as lifeless as Winston felt. The gaping doors and broken windows of battle-damaged houses offered unwanted glimpses into a world he used to belong to but which he was no longer a part of. A dead world. <i>Their</i> world.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Get a bloody move on,&#x201d; Fisher said anxiously, teeth chattering. Winston pulled his head back and Fisher quickly dropped the panel down with a welcome thud, blocking his view. Between them they snatched up their food then scrambled down a steep, grassy bank towards what once used to be a permanently busy road but which was now just a desolate, wide grey scar lined with rusting wrecks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their pitiful condition, the two men both struggled to control their descent down the muddy incline. Wearing dead man&#x2019;s shoes two sizes too big, Fisher fell near to the bottom of the slope, dropping most of the tins and packets he&#x2019;d been carrying and filling the silent world with ugly, unwanted noise. He frantically scooped everything back up again, still constantly checking his surroundings for movement, before racing after Winston who&#x2019;d been too scared to stop.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath a bridge, midway along an otherwise featureless concrete wall, was a corrugated steel roller-shutter and, another couple of metres further along, a metal door. Dirty grey, and with once important warning signs now obscured by a layer of black-speckled grime, the door was well camouflaged. Several freshly smudged handprints around the handle and the edges of the frame were the only faint indications that it had recently been used. Precariously balancing his supplies with one arm, Winston hammered on the door to be let inside. Several seconds passed &#x2013; several seconds too long for his liking &#x2013; before it finally swung open inwards. An emaciated, skeleton-thin man armed with a nail-spiked baseball bat appeared. He frantically ushered Winston and Fisher indoors then peered down the road in either direction before shutting the door again.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stumbling in the sudden darkness, Fisher and Winston followed the short access corridor down towards pool of dull yellow light around the main store where the others were waiting. They kicked other people&#x2019;s belongings out of the way then dumped their hoard in the middle of the room. The other survivors hiding in this dank, highways agency storage depot &#x2013; those who were conscious and still sane - all looked on in disbelief. Sally Marks said what everyone else was thinking. &#x201c;Where the fuck did you get all that?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fisher dropped to his knees and began examining the treasure they&#x2019;d found outside. He grabbed can after can, holding each of them up to the weak light from the single remaining battery powered lantern in turn, struggling to read the labels. Around him, stomachs growled with hunger and mouths began to water at the prospect of food. Corned beef, tinned vegetables, soup . . . how long had it been?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Where did you find it?&#x201d; Sally asked again.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Where he said,&#x201d; Winston answered, pointing at the man in the corner who&#x2019;d recently arrived. Thank god he&#x2019;d found them. He said he&#x2019;d been following the road for days since his last hiding place had been discovered by the enemy, and he&#x2019;d tried to take shelter in their hideout, not realising it was already occupied. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And how did you find it?&#x201d; Sally asked him, unable to make out his face in the shadows.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I already told you,&#x201d; he answered. &#x201c;I saw it just before I found you lot. Couldn&#x2019;t carry it all myself.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Does it really matter?&#x201d; Winston sighed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes it does.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Remember that corner shop by where the coach station used to be?&#x201d; Fisher volunteered.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;On Marlbrook Road?&#x201d; Sally asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the one.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But we&#x2019;ve been there before,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Christ, we&#x2019;ve been there hundreds of times before.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well did we just walk past this stuff all those other times? Did you find a hidden store room we hadn&#x2019;t found before? Open a door you hadn&#x2019;t seen? Someone put this stuff there for us to find, you dumb bastards. It was one of them. It&#x2019;s a trap you fucking idiots, and you walked right into it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What the hell does it matter?&#x201d; Winston spat angrily, struggling with the ring pull on a can of fruit chunks, his fingers numb with cold. &#x201c;No-one followed us back. We only saw one of them in all the time we were out there, and that was just a kid from a distance. If this was a trap then it didn&#x2019;t work. This place is dead. Even they don&#x2019;t come here anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He found us,&#x201d; she said, pointing at the man in the corner again.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That was just luck,&#x201d; Winston argued. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s like us, Sally. He found this place the same way we did.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sally shook her head in despair and walked far enough away into the shadows so that no-one could see her. She leant against the wall and massaged her temples. Maybe Winston was right. She&#x2019;d over-reacted, and not for the first time either. Every day the pressure of being cooped up in here was getting harder and harder to handle. A year ago, all she&#x2019;d had to worry about was getting the kids to and from school and getting to work on time. Hiding in a disused highways storage depot with strangers, eating cold food from a can, shitting in a bucket in full view of the others, fearing for her safety every second of every day . . . if she&#x2019;d known what her life was going to become, she&#x2019;d probably have ended it when the troubles first began.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They tried to make the food last, but more than half of it was gone within an hour, starved stomachs finally gorged after weeks of being drip-fed scraps. It didn&#x2019;t matter. Eating was a distraction which helped reduce the tension in the shelter for a precious few minutes. Sally looked around at the few faces she could see in the low light. Eight-year-old Charlotte stared back at her from the corner where she always sat, surrounded by a barricade of traffic cones and bollards she&#x2019;d built around herself, her face as pale as ever. The two other children sat close by, Chloe fast asleep, eleven-year-old Jake dutifully sitting beside her, drawing shapes in the dirt with a stick. On the opposite side of the room, Jean Walker and Kerry Hayes spoke together in hushed whispers about nothing of any importance. Sally had thought Kerry beautiful when she&#x2019;d first met her, but her young body had been ravaged by hunger since they&#x2019;d had to lock themselves away in here. Her full figure had wasted away to nothing. She looked anorexic now: all protruding bones, stretched skin and straw-like hair. In the diagonally opposite corner, Brian Greene did his best to disguise the fact that he was crying again . . .</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A packet of stale biscuits (what luxury, Sally thought to herself dejectedly) was being passed around. She took one, but stopped before she ate it, distracted suddenly by a low rumbling in the distance.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did anyone hear that?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hear what?&#x201d; Kerry asked, immediately concerned, yellow eyes bulging in the light.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Thought I heard something,&#x201d; she said, already beginning to doubt herself. &#x201c;Sounded like an engine.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing,&#x201d; Fisher said quickly, scowling at her. &#x201c;Just <i>them</i> moving around up there. Either that or your imagination . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was probably right. She couldn&#x2019;t hear anything now. Sally passed the packet on to the man sitting next to her &#x2013; the new arrival. He&#x2019;d hardly spoken since he&#x2019;d got here but it was obvious he was as desperate as the rest of them: a scrawny bag of skin and bone, a haunted expression etched permanently onto his weary face. He took the biscuits from Sally, then passed them on without saying a word. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He waited for a few minutes longer before quietly getting up and slipping further back into the shadows. He stepped over and around a couple of bodies &#x2013; one sleeping, one dying &#x2013; then made his way through to the part of the cramped storage depot shelter which they used as a toilet. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sally tried to block out the foul noise of the man pissing from a height into a metal bucket, and was relieved when it finally stopped. She waited for him to come back, but became concerned when he didn&#x2019;t immediately return. The rest of the shelter was almost pitch black but she got up and felt her way along the cold, damp walls until she found him. He was lying on the ground on his back, trying to force the roller-shutter open. A chink of light spilled across the floor where he&#x2019;d managed to get his fingers under the shutter. With a grunt of effort he lifted it up another six inches.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What the hell are you doing?&#x201d; Sally asked, standing directly behind him. He didn&#x2019;t answer. Didn&#x2019;t even look at her. Instead he kept working, shoving his hands further under the shutter and forcing it up another couple of inches at a time. He rolled over onto his front and was about to try and slide through the gap when she grabbed the heel of his boot and pulled him back.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t panic,&#x201d; she pleaded with him, keeping her voice low so the others didn&#x2019;t hear. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t do anything stupid. I know it&#x2019;s hard being trapped in here but don&#x2019;t-&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He crawled back and stood up.

Stretched over The Entire is a lid of plasma, called the bright, which ebbs and flows, bringing day and twilight. Under the vast canopy of the bright live many galactic species, copied from our own universe. <br><br>Former star pilot Titus Quinn loves The Entire, but now he must risk annihilating it by destroying the fortress of Ahnenhoon. To sustain a faltering Entire, Ahnenhoon's great engine will soon reach through the brane separating the universes and consume our own universe in a concentrated ball of fire. <br><br>Quinn sets off on a journey across The Entire armed with the nan, a small ankle bracelet containing nanoscale military technology that can reduce Ahnenhoon and its deadly engine to chaos. He must pursue his mission even though his wife is held prisoner in Ahnenhoon and his own daughter has sent the assassin MoTi to hunt him down. <br><br>As he traverses the galactic distances of The Entire, he learns more of the secrets of its geography, its fragile storm walls, its eons-long history, and the factions that contend for dominance. One of these factions is led by his daughter, who though young and a slave, has at her command a transforming and revolutionary power. <br><br>As Quinn wrestles with looming disaster and approaches the fabled concentric rings of Ahnenhoon's defenses, he learns that in the Entire, nothing is what it appears. Its denizens are all harboring secrets, and the greatest of these is the nature of the Entire itself.</p><p>Kay Kenyon sold her first science fiction novel, <i>The Seeds of Time, </i>to Bantam in 1997. Within a few years she left a career in consulting to become a full-time writer. Several subsequent novels were short-listed for such awards as the Philip K. Dick (<i>Maximum Ice</i>) and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award (<i>The Braided World</i>.) Her short fiction has appeared in numerous anthologies such as <i>Fast Forward 2</i>, <i>The Solaris Book of New Science Fiction, </i>and<i> Shine, An Anthology of Optimistic Science Fiction.</i> In &nbsp;2007 the first book in her sci-fantasy quartet, The Entire and The Rose, was published by Pyr. Publishers Weekly listed book one, <i>Bright of the Sky</i>, among the top 150 books of the year. The series (rounded out by <i>A World Too Near</i>, <i>City Without End</i> and <i>Prince of Storms</i>) has twice been shortlisted for the American Library Association Reading List awards. The four books &nbsp;are available in trade paper, Kindle, and Audible.com versions.<i> Bright of the Sky</i> is free on Kindle. Kenyon is a founding board member of the Write on the River writers' conference in Eastern Washington. She regularly writes on fiction topics and the writing life at her blog, Writing the World.In the second Entire and the Rose volume (after Bright of the Sky, 2007), Titus Quinn returns to the Entire, wearing a nanotech cirque, with which he intends to destroy the engine at Ahnenhoon. He isn&#x2019;t alone, as Minerva Corporation assured him he would be. Helice Maki, ever plotting for her own ambitions, accompanies him. His daughter Sydney continues bringing the Inyx together (when enough have gathered, they&#x2019;ll seek out the thoughts of the Tarig), and his wife, Johanna, attempts learning the secrets of Ahnenhoon so she can lead him to the engine when he arrives. En route, Quinn encounters old friends and new allies, Sydney and the Inyx discover an unsettling secret of the Tarig, and Johanna walks the fine edge of risk. Kenyon&#x2019;s splinter world remains a vibrant, fascinating place. An undercurrent of convoluted politics runs through it, and intense action follows. It promises to get even more interesting in the next volume, which Kenyon&#x2019;s knack for creating characters with shifting allegiances and conflicting loyalties makes something to look forward to. --Regina Schroeder</p><h2>The Mother Chimpanzee (Mother Animal Series)</h2><p>Describes the relationship of a mother and baby chimpanzee.</p><p></p><h2>From Tree To Tree House</h2><p>From Tree to Tree House introduces young readers to real-life heroes---the loggers, manufacturers and lumberyard workers who help build America.</p><p></p><h2>Thayer&#39;s Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament</h2><p>A Dictionary Numerically Coded To Strong&#39;s Exhaustive Concordance</p><p></p><h2>Among Women: Poems</h2><p><p>In <i>Among Women</i>, Shinder courageously explores men's fear of sexual intimacy using a personal, very private voice that whispers from the mire of lived human experience. In crisp, clean lines, the poems accurately convey the vulnerability, longing, and shame associated with the fear of human contact and communication. Sometimes achingly sensual, though never sentimental, Shinder treats this subject with daring and originality.</p></p><p><b>Jason Shinder</b> (1955&#x2013;2008) was the author of three poetry collections and the editor of <i>The Poem That Changed America: "Howl" Fifty Years Later</i>. He directed the YMCA National Writer's Voice and taught at the Writing Seminars at Bennington College.The deliberate poems in Shinder's second volume of verse concentrate on masculinity, love and hetero sex accordingly they are also interested in embarrassment; in fathers, sons and families; in men's ideas about women; in self-discovery; and in self-inculpation. The poems' quiet language, slow pace and emotional pitch, like their short-lined, triadic stanzas, will remind many readers of Stephen Dunn's verse, and perhaps of Raymond Carver's. Those writers' fans may appreciate Shinder's frankness: "I'm afraid/ if I come/ I'll sound like someone// I don't know," he begins one poem; the next asks "Oh God of paradise,// whom/ have I ever loved/ except through me?" Some poems vouchsafe epiphanies; other chronicle absurd and touching sexual failures. Other still ask questions about love: "Have we ever arrived// in the arms of someone/ who wasn't lost/ from the start?" The deliberate clarity and accessibility tend toward stabs at Carver-esque profundity, and the results are often boring, and on occasion silly: "Ocean. Irene.// We are ocean./ Night. Irene./ We are night." Brought together from magazine publication, the poems seem here to be too much like one another, and too restricted in their forms and tones, to back up the best of the lot. While pitched as an antidote to the insistent (if now somewhat muted or ironized) chest-beating of most male-centered narrative verse, the poems end up bolstering the very categories they seek to question. (Apr.) Forecast: Shinder is the founder and director of the YMCA National Writer's Voice, director of the Sundance Institute's writing program, a writing teacher at Bennington College and New School University, and an indefatigable anthologist (he is series editor of the Best American Movie Writing and of a series of Harcourt collections of family poems) so this book should reach a variety of readers interested in his work. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Windowpane</h2><p><p><strong>The first collection of <em>Windowpane</em>, Joe Kessler's critically-acclaimed series of progressive narrative comics, is a showcase of the cartoonist's mastery of form and colour.</strong></p><p><em>Windowpane</em> is Joe Kessler's one-man-anthology of short-narrative, experimental, sometimes-allegorical comics.

Sharpe, a materialist feminist, is scrupulous in her use of theory to articulate nationalism, historical race-gendering, and contemporary feminist critique.&#x201d; -Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Columbia University&#x201c;Jenny Sharpe has done a great service in opening up the virtually taboo subject of the rape of the white woman by the colored man, and, furthermore, in teaching us theory - making by locating this frenzy of fantasy and reality within a specific crisis of European colonialism in India. ... In showing how a &#x2018;wild anthropology&#x2019; must continuously rework feminism in the face of racism, and vice versa, she shows how the margins of empire were and still are at its center.&#x201d; -Michael Taussig, New York UniversityAllegories of Empire introduces race and colonialism to feminist theories of rape and sexual difference, deploying women&#x2019;s writing to undo the appropriation of English (universal) womanhood for the perpetuation of Empire.Sharpe brings the historical memory of the 1857 Indian Mutiny to bear upon the theme of rape in British adn Anglo-Indian fiction. She argues that the idea of Indian men raping white women was not part of the colonial landscape prior to the revolt that was remembered as the savage attack of mutinous Indian soldiers on defenseless English women.By showing how contemporary theories of female agency are implicated in an imperial past, Sharpe argues that such models are inappropriate, not only for discussion of colonized women, but for European women as well. Ultimately, she insists that feminist theory must begin from difference and dislocation rather than from identity and correspondence if it is to get beyond the race-gender-class impasse.Jenny Sharpe received her Ph.D. in comparative literature at the University of Texas at Austin and is currently a professor of English at the University of California at Los Angeles.

Original.</p><p></p><h2>Athens: A Portrait of the City in Its Golden Age</h2><p>A lively and accessible history of Athens's rise to greatness, from one of the foremost classical historians.<br><br>The definitive account of Athens in the age of Pericles, Christian Meier's gripping study begins with the Greek triumph over Persia at the Battle of Salamis, one of the most significant military victories in history. Meier shows how that victory decisively established Athens's military dominance in the Mediterranean and made possible its rise to preeminence in almost every field of human eavor--commerce, science, philosophy, art, architecture, and literature. Within seventy-five years, Athens had become the most original and innovative civilization the ancient world ever produced.<br><br>With elegant narrative style, Meier traces the birth of democracy and the flourishing of Greek culture in the fifth century B.C., as well as Athens' slow decline and defeat in the Peloponnesian War. The great figures--from politicians and generals like Themistocles and Alcibiades to the philosophers Socrates and Plato--emerge as flesh-and-blood human beings, firmly rooted in their times and places. This is history in the tradition of Simon Schama and Barbara Tuchman--learned, accessible, and beautifully written.<br></p><p>Ancient Athens is remembered today as the cradle of a civilization that stands as an ideal of the reasoned life, as the source of radical transformations of thought that remain with us today in ideas of citizenship, freedom, political organization, and social obligation. Christian Meier gently reminds us, however, that in this context, Athens was a collective of landed citizens numbering fewer than 150,000 individuals spanning four generations in the 6th and 5th centuries B.C. <p> Meier's sweeping narrative begins with the decisive Athenian victory at the battle of Salamis, when a hastily assembled fleet held off the much mightier navy of the Persian emperor, Xerxes. It was in war, Meier suggests, that Athens first came to see itself as a place unlike any other. When they were not battling Persians, Athenians often fought neighboring city-states over, say, who would have the right to host a round of Olympic games or control shipping lanes. (The Athenians, quipped Thucydides, "were born into the world to take no rest themselves and to give none to others.") The Athenian penchant for fighting with their neighbors--and, when neighbors were otherwise occupied, amongst themselves--led to the city-state's decline at the end of the Peloponnesian War in 404 B.C., when Meier's saga draws to a close.</p><p> Meier brings a flair for storytelling to his thoroughgoing portrait of Athens's shining moment, with a cast of characters strong on well-known figures like Solon, Alcibiades, Euripides, and Socrates. Meier also writes with self-effacing modesty, noting that his is but one interpretation among many and that history that, as his does, "obeys the law of narrative sequence [is] the most time-honored perspective for curtailing understanding." Yet <i>Athens</i> does nothing of the sort, offering instead a fine overview of the complexities of Athenian life from which every reader of classical history will profit. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Christian Meier is a professor of ancient history at the University of Munich.

Those short, clear passages are, however, virtual islets of good writing in a puddle of clich� and syrupy platitudes. This thin book is mainly a chain of tiny, advice-giving chapters that sound like an audition for The View. Yes, stay-at-home dads are rare, but the concept of them is no longer novel. That relegates this book to the shrinking group of parents who are only now finding that men can play big roles in homemaking. In other words, this book is dated.

But other than restating the nightly, darkest-hours task of monitoring his daughter&#x2019;s blood sugar, he does not take us inside this situation or its affect on his family.

In <i>Owners of the Sidewalk</i> Daniel M. Goldstein examines the ways these systems correlate in the marginal spaces of the Latin American city. Collaborating with the Cancha's legal and permanent stall vendors (<i>fijos</i>) and its illegal and itinerant street and sidewalk vendors (<i>ambulantes</i>), Goldstein shows how the state's deliberate neglect and criminalization of the Cancha's poor&#x2014;a practice common to neoliberal modern cities&#x2014;makes the poor exploitable, governable, and consigns them to an insecure existence. Goldstein's collaborative and engaged approach to ethnographic field research also opens up critical questions about what ethical scholarship entails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Daniel M.

Here, Epel (host of a Berkeley-based radio show) presents commentary from 26 writers on how dreams have influenced their work and their lives. Though the commentary derives from interviews, Epel has edited out her questions and sewn the answers into smooth-flowing essays from the likes of Maya Angelou, Clive Barker, Elmore Leonard, Gloria Naylor, Reynolds Price, Anne Rice, Robert Stone, and Amy Tan--a remarkable number of whom keep close track (often in dream-journals) of the dreams from which they draw literary ideas or at least inspiration: John Barth says that once every four years or so, he enjoys a ``Charles-Dickens-scale dream,'' one ``with lots of complications and even subplots.'' And it's interesting to note that, perhaps in keeping with the intimacy of the dreaming that influences them, a number of these authors disavow word processors in favor of more intimate writing tools: Elmore Leonard writes in longhand and then transcribes using an Olympia manual typewriter, while Spalding Gray corrects his longhand again in longhand, with a red-ink pen. Full of surprising insights, these interview/essays make a genuine contribution to our understanding of the writing process. (Twenty-six b&amp;w photos--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Epel, a writer, dream researcher, radio talk-show host, and literary escort, has compiled interviews with 26 fiction authors she has chauffeured around San Francisco. She explores how these writers turn their dreams into art, how dreams affect their personal lives, and how their own questions about their dreams reveal their creative processes. A page-length biographical sketch and a photo precede each author's chapter. The monologs are often stream of consciousness and cover topics tangential to dreams but related to writing as well: e.g., Maya Angelou discusses overcoming writer's block; Sue Grafton describes plotting a mystery; and Stephen King examines symbolism.

Basquiat first came to prominence when he collaborated with Al Diaz to spray-paint enigmatic statements under the pseudonym SAMO�. He went on to work on collages, Xerox art, postcards, performances, and music before establishing his reputation as one of the most important painters of his generation. Accompanying a major exhibition at the Barbican Art Gallery, this book opens with introductory essays from the curators, which place his practice in a wider art historical context and look at his career through the lens of performance. Six thematic chapters offer new research, with essays from poet Christian Campbell on SAMO�; curator Carlo McCormick on New York / New Wave; writer Glenn O&#x2019;Brien on the downtown scene; academic Jordana Moore Saggese on Basquiat&#x2019;s relationship to film and television; and music scholar Francesco Martinelli on Basquiat&#x2019;s obsession with jazz. This insightful new survey also features extended captions, rare archival material, and extensive photography, demonstrating how Basquiat&#x2019;s legacy remains more powerful and relevant than ever today.</p><p></p><h2>THE ATLAS OF ALBERTA.</h2><p>THE ATLAS OF ALBERTA</p><p></p><h2>World According to Sempe</h2><p>This series centers around the experiences of a child and a child&#39;s interpretation of the world.</p><p></p><h2>Portraits from the Age of Exploration: Selections from Andre Thevet&#39;s *Les vrais pourtraits et vies des hommes illustres*</h2><p>One of the most ambitious works of Renaissance biography, Andre Thevet's two-volume Vrais pourtraits gave Europeans unique insights into the New World. Portraits from the age of Exploration - each biography chosen for its interest to modern readers - is the first translation of Thevet's work into English and the first to feature reproductions of the original copper-engraved portraits of each subject.<br>The selections, twelve chapters from Thevet's original work, describe the exploits of six famous European explorers and six Native American chiefs. The explorers are Columbus, Magellan, Cortes, Pizarro, Albuquerque, and Vespucci; the chiefs are Montezuma, Atahualpa, Nacol-absou (King of the Promontory of the Cannibals), Paracoussi Satoriona (King of the Platte), and Quoniambec. The biographies of Native Americans represented a first in European literature. Thevet's information came from written and oral sources, from his own experience as a colonist in Brazil, and from other eyewitness accounts.<br>Roger Schlesinger's annotations and introduction link Thevet's work to the body of sixteenth-century exploration literature, and Edward Benson's translation negotiates Thevet's verbal flourishes with skill. The book provides a unique insight into the European mentality of the Age of Exploration.

The beach in Los Angeles&#x2014;white sand, crashing blue water, you&#x2019;re strolling along the tide line&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace cracked an eye open. &#x201c;This sounds very romantic.&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy sitting across from him sighed and ran his hands through his shaggy dark hair. Though it was a cold December day, werewolves didn&#x2019;t feel weather as acutely as humans, and Jordan had his jacket off and his shirtsleeves rolled up. They were seated opposite each other on a patch of browning grass in a clearing in Central Park, both cross-legged, their hands on their knees, palms up.<br> <br>An outcropping of rock rose from the ground near them. It was broken up into larger and smaller boulders, and atop one of the larger boulders perched Alec and Isabelle Lightwood. As Jace looked up, Isabelle caught his eye and gave him an encouraging wave. Alec, noting her gesture, smacked her shoulder. Jace could see him lecturing Izzy, probably about not breaking Jace&#x2019;s concentration. He smiled to himself&#x2014;neither of them really had a reason to be here, but they had come anyway, &#x201c;for moral support.&#x201d; Though, Jace suspected it had more to do with the fact that Alec hated to be at loose ends these days, Isabelle hated for her brother to be on his own, and both of them were avoiding their parents and the Institute.<br> <br>Jordan snapped his fingers under Jace&#x2019;s nose. &#x201c;Are you paying any attention?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace frowned. &#x201c;I was, until we wandered into the territory of bad personal ads.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, what kind of thing does make you feel calm and peaceful?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace took his hands off his knees&#x2014;the lotus position was giving him wrist cramps&#x2014;and leaned back on his arms. Chilly wind rattled the few dead leaves that still clung to the branches of the trees. Against the pale winter sky the leaves had a spare elegance, like pen and ink sketches. &#x201c;Killing demons,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;A good clean kill is very relaxing. The messy ones are more annoying, because you have to clean up afterward&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Jordan held his hands up. Below the sleeves of his shirt, the tattoos that wrapped his arms were visible. Shaantih, shaantih, shaantih. Jace knew it meant &#x201c;the peace that passes understanding&#x201d; and that you were supposed to say the word three times every time you uttered the mantra, to calm your mind. But nothing seemed to calm his, these days. The fire in his veins made his mind race too, thoughts coming too quickly, one after another, like exploding fireworks. Dreams as vivid and saturated with color as oil paintings. He&#x2019;d tried training it out of himself, hours and hours spent in the practice room, blood and bruises and sweat and once, even, broken fingers. But he hadn&#x2019;t managed to do much more than irritate Alec with requests for healing runes and, on one memorable occasion, accidentally set fire to one of the crossbeams.<br> <br>It was Simon who had pointed out that his roommate meditated every day, and who&#x2019;d said that learning the habit was what had calmed the uncontrollable fits of rage that were often part of the transformation into a werewolf. From there it had been a short jump to Clary suggesting that Jace &#x201c;might as well try it,&#x201d; and here they were, at his second session. The first session had ended with Jace burning a mark into Simon and Jordan&#x2019;s hardwood floor, so Jordan had suggested they take it outside for the second round to prevent further property damage.<br> <br>&#x201c;No killing,&#x201d; Jordan said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re trying to make you feel peaceful. Blood, killing, war, those are all non-peaceful things. Isn&#x2019;t there anything else you like?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Weapons,&#x201d; said Jace. &#x201c;I like weapons.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m starting to think we have a problematic issue of personal philosophy here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace leaned forward, his palms flat on the grass. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a warrior,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I was brought up as a warrior. I didn&#x2019;t have toys, I had weapons. I slept with a wooden sword until I was five. My first books were medieval demonologies with illuminated pages. The first songs I learned were chants to banish demons. I know what brings me peace, and it isn&#x2019;t sandy beaches or chirping birds in rain forests. I want a weapon in my hand and a strategy to win.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jordan looked at him levelly. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re saying that what brings you peace is war.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace threw his hands up and stood, brushing grass off his jeans. &#x201c;Now you get it.&#x201d; He heard the crackle of dry grass and turned, in time to see Clary duck through a gap between two trees and emerge into the clearing, Simon only a few steps behind her. Clary had her hands in her back pockets and she was laughing.<br> <br>Jace watched them for a moment&#x2014;there was something about looking at people who didn&#x2019;t know they were being watched. He remembered the second time he had ever seen Clary, across the main room of Java Jones. She&#x2019;d been laughing and talking with Simon the way she was doing now. He remembered the unfamiliar twist of jealousy in his chest, pressing out his breath, the feeling of satisfaction when she&#x2019;d left Simon behind to come and talk to him.<br> <br>Things did change. He&#x2019;d gone from being eaten up with jealousy of Simon, to a grudging respect for his tenacity and courage, to actually considering him a friend, though he doubted he&#x2019;d ever say so out loud. Jace watched as Clary looked over and blew him a kiss, her red hair bouncing in its ponytail. She was so small&#x2014;delicate, doll-like, he had thought once, before he&#x2019;d learned how strong she was.<br> <br>She headed toward Jace and Jordan, leaving Simon to scamper up the rocky ground to where Alec and Isabelle were sitting; he collapsed beside Isabelle, who immediately leaned over to say something to him, her black curtain of hair hiding her face.<br> <br>Clary stopped in front of Jace, rocking back on her heels with a smile. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s it coming along?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jordan wants me to think about the beach,&#x201d; Jace said gloomily.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s stubborn,&#x201d; Clary said to Jordan. &#x201c;What he means is that he appreciates it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t, really,&#x201d; said Jace.<br> <br>Jordan snorted. &#x201c;Without me you&#x2019;d be bouncing down Madison Avenue, shooting sparks out of all your orifices.&#x201d; He rose to his feet, shrugging on his green jacket. &#x201c;Your boyfriend&#x2019;s crazy,&#x201d; he said to Clary.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, but he&#x2019;s hot,&#x201d; said Clary. &#x201c;So there&#x2019;s that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jordan made a face, but it was good-natured. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m heading out,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Got to meet Maia downtown.&#x201d; He gave a mock salute and was gone, slipping into the trees and vanishing with the silent tread of the wolf he was under the skin. Jace watched him go. Unlikely saviors, he thought. Six months ago he wouldn&#x2019;t have believed anyone who&#x2019;d told him he was going to wind up taking behavioral lessons from a werewolf.<br> <br>Jordan and Simon and Jace had struck up something of a friendship in the past months. Jace couldn&#x2019;t help using their apartment as a refuge, away from the daily pressures of the Institute, away from the reminders that the Clave was still unprepared for war with Sebastian.<br> <br>Erchomai. The word brushed the back of Jace&#x2019;s mind like the touch of a feather, making him shiver. He saw an angel&#x2019;s wing, torn from its body, lying in a pool of golden blood.<br> <br>I am coming.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; Clary said; Jace suddenly looked a million miles away. Since the heavenly fire had entered his body, he&#x2019;d tended to drift off more into his head. She had a feeling that it was a side effect of suppressing his emotions. She felt a little pang&#x2014;Jace, when she had met him, had been so controlled, only a little of his real self leaking out through the cracks in his personal armor, like light through the chinks in a wall. It had taken a long time to break down those defenses. Now, though, the fire in his veins was forcing him to put them back up, to bite down on his emotions for safety&#x2019;s sake. But when the fire was gone, would he be able to dismantle them again?<br> <br>He blinked, called back by her voice. The winter sun was high and cold; it sharpened the bones of his face and threw the shadows under his eyes into relief. He reached for her hand, taking a deep breath. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; he said in the quiet, more serious voice he reserved only for her. &#x201c;It is helping&#x2014;the lessons with Jordan. It is helping, and I do appreciate it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Clary curled her hand around his wrist. His skin felt warm under her touch; he seemed to run several degrees hotter than normal since his encounter with Glorious. His heart still pounded its familiar, steady rhythm, but the blood being pushed through his veins seemed to thrum under her touch with the kinetic energy of a fire just about to catch.<br> <br>She went up on her toes to kiss his cheek, but he turned, and their lips brushed. They&#x2019;d done nothing more than kiss since the fire had first started singing in his blood, and they&#x2019;d done even that carefully. Jace was careful now, his mouth sliding softly against hers, his hand closing on her shoulder. For a moment they were body to body, and she felt the thrum and pulse of his blood. He moved to pull her closer, and a sharp, dry spark passed between them, like the zing of static electricity.<br> <br>Jace broke off the kiss and stepped back with an exhale; before Clary could say anything, a chorus of sarcastic applause broke out from the nearby hill. Simon, Isabelle, and Alec waved at them. Jace bowed while Clary stepped back slightly sheepishly, hooking her thumbs into the belt of her jeans.<br> <br>Jace sighed. &#x201c;Shall we join our annoying, voyeuristic friends?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Unfortunately, that&#x2019;s the only kind of friends we have.&#x201d; Clary bumped her shoulder against his arm, and they headed up toward the rocks. Simon and Isabelle were side by side, talking quietly. Alec was sitting a little apart, staring at the screen of his phone with an expression of intense concentration.<br> <br>Jace threw himself down next to his parabatai. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard that if you stare at those things enough, they&#x2019;ll ring.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s been texting Magnus,&#x201d; said Isabelle, glancing over with a disapproving look.<br> <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Alec said automatically.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, you have,&#x201d; said Jace, craning to look over Alec&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;And calling. I can see your outgoing calls.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s his birthday,&#x201d; Alec said, flipping the phone shut. He looked smaller these days, almost skinny in his worn blue pullover, holes at the elbows, his lips bitten and chapped. Clary&#x2019;s heart went out to him. He&#x2019;d spent the first week after Magnus had broken up with him in a sort of daze of sadness and disbelief. None of them could really believe it. She&#x2019;d always thought Magnus loved Alec, really loved him; clearly Alec had thought so too. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want him to think that I didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;to think that I forgot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re pining,&#x201d; said Jace.<br> <br>Alec shrugged. &#x201c;Look who&#x2019;s talking. &#x2018;Oh, I love her. Oh, she&#x2019;s my sister. Oh why, why, why&#x2014;&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>Jace threw a handful of dead leaves at Alec, making him splutter.<br> <br>Isabelle was laughing. &#x201c;You know he&#x2019;s right, Jace.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Give me your phone,&#x201d; Jace said, ignoring Isabelle. &#x201c;Come on, Alexander.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s none of your business,&#x201d; Alec said, holding the phone away. &#x201c;Just forget about it, okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t eat, you don&#x2019;t sleep, you stare at your phone, and I&#x2019;m supposed to forget about it?&#x201d; Jace said. There was a surprising amount of agitation in his voice; Clary knew how upset he&#x2019;d been that Alec was unhappy, but she wasn&#x2019;t sure Alec knew it. Under normal circumstances Jace would have killed, or at least threatened, anyone who hurt Alec; this was different. Jace liked to win, but you couldn&#x2019;t win out over a broken heart, even someone else&#x2019;s. Even someone you loved.<br> <br>Jace leaned over and grabbed the phone out of his parabatai&#x2019;s hand. Alec protested and reached for it, but Jace held him off with one hand, expertly scrolling through the messages on the phone with the other. &#x201c;Magnus, just call me back. I need to know if you&#x2019;re okay&#x2014;&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;Okay, no. Just no.&#x201d; With a decisive move he snapped the phone in half. The screen went blank as Jace dropped the pieces to the ground. &#x201c;There.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alec looked down at the shattered pieces in disbelief. &#x201c;You BROKE my PHONE.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace shrugged. &#x201c;Guys don&#x2019;t let other guys keep calling other guys. Okay, that came out wrong. Friends don&#x2019;t let friends keep calling their exes and hanging up. Seriously. You have to stop.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alec looked furious. &#x201c;So you broke my brand-new phone? Thanks a lot.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace smiled serenely and lay back on the rock. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Look on the bright side,&#x201d; Isabelle said. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t be able to get texts from Mom anymore. She&#x2019;s texted me six times today. I turned my phone off.&#x201d; She patted her pocket with a significant look.<br> <br>&#x201c;What does she want?&#x201d; Simon asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Constant meetings,&#x201d; Isabelle said. &#x201c;Depositions. The Clave keeps wanting to hear what happened when we fought Sebastian at the Burren. We&#x2019;ve all had to give accounts, like, fifty times. How Jace absorbed the heavenly fire from Glorious. Descriptions of the Dark Shadowhunters, the Infernal Cup, the weapons they used, the runes that were on them. What we were wearing, what Sebastian was wearing, what everyone was wearing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like phone sex but boring.&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon made a choking noise.<br> <br>&#x201c;What we think Sebastian wants,&#x201d; Alec added. &#x201c;When he&#x2019;ll come back. What he&#x2019;ll do when he does.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary leaned her elbows on her knees. &#x201c;Always good to know the Clave has a well-thought-out and reliable plan.&#x201d; For a moment she regretted her words, remembering that Robert Lightwood was the new Inquisitor. But his children didn&#x2019;t seem bothered by her comment in the least.<br> <br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t want to believe it,&#x201d; said Jace, staring at the sky. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the problem. No matter how many times we tell them what we saw at the Burren. No matter how many times we tell them how dangerous the Endarkened are. They don&#x2019;t want to believe that Nephilim could really be corrupted. That Shadowhunters could kill Shadowhunters.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary had been there when Sebastian had created the first of the Endarkened. She had seen the blankness in their eyes, the fury with which they&#x2019;d fought. They terrified her. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not Shadowhunters anymore,&#x201d; she added in a low voice. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not people.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to believe that if you haven&#x2019;t seen it,&#x201d; Alec said. &#x201c;And Sebastian has only so many of them. A small force, scattered&#x2014;they don&#x2019;t want to believe he&#x2019;s really a threat. Or if he is a threat, they&#x2019;d rather believe it was more a threat to us, to New York, than to Shadowhunters at large.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not wrong that if Sebastian cares about anything, it&#x2019;s about Clary,&#x201d; Jace said, and Clary felt a cold shiver at her spine, a mixture of disgust and apprehension. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t really have emotions. Not like we do. But if he did, he&#x2019;d have them about her. And he has them about Jocelyn. He hates her.&#x201d; He paused, thoughtful. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;d be likely to strike directly here. Too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. obvious.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you told the Clave this,&#x201d; Simon said.<br> <br>&#x201c;About a thousand times,&#x201d; said Jace. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think they hold my insights in particularly high regard.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary looked down at her hands. She had been deposed by the Clave, just like the rest of them; she&#x2019;d given answers to all their questions. There were still things about Sebastian she hadn&#x2019;t told them, hadn&#x2019;t told anyone. The things he&#x2019;d said he wanted from her.<br> <br>She hadn&#x2019;t dreamed much since they&#x2019;d come back from the Burren with Jace&#x2019;s veins full of fire, but when she did have nightmares, they were about her brother.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like trying to fight a ghost,&#x201d; Jace said. &#x201c;They can&#x2019;t track Sebastian, they can&#x2019;t find him, they can&#x2019;t find the Shadowhunters he&#x2019;s turned.&#x201d;<br> <br>...</p><h2>Shit Doesn&#39;t Just Happen: Titanic, Kegworth, Custer, Schoolhouse, Donner, Tulips, Apollo 13: The Gift of Failure</h2><p>Saying &#x201c;shit happens&#x201d; indicates events are random, have no meaning and there is no accountability or responsibility.

Now a superb new biography illuminates the life of this amazing, reclusive, deeply contradictory man.<br><br>Born in 1791, Faraday was the son of a blacksmith with a thin education, yet he was gifted with a rare intelligence and intuition. He was a devout member of a small Christian sect that believed in the Bible&#x2019;s literal word, yet he was open to all that humankind could invent from earthly knowledge. He was ambitious and savvy about spreading news of his work, yet he patented nothing and received no personal gain. In short, Faraday personified all the paradoxes of the early nineteenth century, a landscape in which class, faith, and desire clashed.<br><br>As apprentice to the esteemed Humphrey Davy of the Royal Institution, he helped discover the miner&#x2019;s safety lamp, which revolutionized the search for and accumulation of coal, then went on to make a landmark study of induction, the connection between electricity and magnetism, and the idea of the electromagnetic field. From electric motors to precision-made eyeglass lenses to steel razors to liquid chlorine, his inventions&#x2013;often designed with self-created instruments&#x2013;have become staples of civilized society, the &#x201c;roots of modern life.&#x201d;<br><br>While rising in society, Faraday steered clear of politics and the seamy machinations of the material world, staying obedient to a higher authority. Though disdainful of &#x201c;useless passion&#x201d; and devoted to his wife, he found a confidante in the bright, liberated, and flirtatious daughter of Lord Byron. Trying to reconcile his severe religion and his demanding work, he eventually suffered a mental collapse. <br><br>An acclaimed biographer of artists, James Hamilton now captures the entire fascinating story of this individual and his era. <i>A Life of Discovery </i>is the definitive account of a remarkable man who merged intuition and logic, prayer and deduction.</p><p>JAMES HAMILTON is University Curator at the University of Birmingham, U.K., and Honorary Research Fellow at the Barber Institute of Fine Arts, University of Birmingham. He was Alistair Horne Fellow at St. Anthony&#x2019;s College, Oxford, 1998&#x2014;1999, and is the author of <i>Turner: A Life</i>. He lives near Oxford, England.*Starred Review* When his experiments went explosively awry, Michael Faraday repeatedly found his eyes filled with glass and his own blood. But a perceptive biographer allows readers to see much more than shattered laboratory equipment through eyes eventually famous for penetrating the mysteries of electricity. Indeed, Hamilton invites readers to see those contours of Faraday's life often neglected by biographers narrowly focused on his electrical research. We see, for instance, how, when shielded from public scrutiny, the mature genius but still straitlaced man allowed himself remarkable intimacy in correspondence with a free-spirited female mathematician. Even in turning to Faraday's acclaimed science, Hamilton highlights the nonscientific, exploring the piquant personalities of the mentors and collaborators who helped Faraday on his way and tracing the remarkably artistic metaphors Faraday employed in explaining his breakthroughs. And alongside a lucid scientific account of how Faraday's daring mind united wires and magnets in the world's first generator, Hamilton offers an acute psychological analysis of the peculiar fissures dividing that mind. Readers thus join Hamilton in pondering the curious schizophrenia that allowed Faraday to crusade for educational reform with poise but still left him insecure and self-abasing when addressing his own Protestant community on religious issues. A complete portrait, restoring full humanity to a scientific icon. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Expanding on themes such as the cozy relationship of intellectuals to the state and American adventurism after World War II, Chomsky goes on to examine the way that U.S. policymakers set about the task of rewriting the horrible history of involvement in Indochina and turned their attention more squarely on the Middle East and Central America. Chomsky also assesses U.S. oil strategy and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, dissects the first volume of Kissinger&#x2019;s memoirs, issues an urgent call to stem the bloodshed in then-unknown East Timor and, in the title essay, marks the increased posture of confrontation and rearmament under presidents Carter and Reagan that signaled the end of d�tente with the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Featuring a new foreword by internationally acclaimed journalist John Pilger, this is the fifth in a series of Chomsky&#x2019;s classic political works reissued by The New Press.

Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Rebirth of the story of Isis and Osiris in modern times: the 12th book by Cott (Wandering Ghost, 1991, etc.), a contributing editor for Rolling Stone and Parabola. Drawing on various sources, from Plutarch to Joseph Campbell to Norman Mailer's Ancient Evenings (``the most volatile and audacious version...in modern times''), Cott retells the story of Isis and Osiris, twin sister and brother, wife and husband, goddess and god--a simple story with many twists. Osiris seems to be the god of resurrection and Isis goddess of the mother principle--or, Cott says, so it seems in modern eyes. He interviews Dr. James P. Allen, a noted author of Egyptian creation myths and an associate curator of the Department of Egyptian Art at the Metropolitan Museum, who goes quite finely into family ties among the gods but thinks that the anal insemination of Set by Osiris and of Osiris by Set did not mean that sodomy was acceptable to ancient Egyptians. At Clonegal Castle, Ireland, Cott joins with Olivia Robertson and her brother Lawrence Durdin-Robertson, archpriestess and hierophant, who have their own Temple of Isis and spearhead a revival for worship of the Egyptian gods with the Fellowship of Isis, an organization of some 11,000 people living in 60 countries, including Ireland, Japan, Nigeria, the US, India, and New Zealand. Despite bad vibes in the tabloids, the 70-plus Olivia insists that ``We don't have orgies, we have ecstasies.'' Cott also visits the Ammonite Foundation in Egypt; and the Isis and Osiris Workshop in Edmonton, Canada, run by psychologists of archetypes, Evangeline Kane and her husband Franklin, who give the myth absorbing Jungian interpretations. More journalistic than inspired or in any way convincing. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In this exotic piece of reportage, Cott ( The Search for Omm Sety ) first retells the Egyptian myth of Isis, goddess of fertility and healing, who restored to life her murdered twin brother and lover Osiris. Cott then investigates the myth's continuing appeal to contemporary devotees, some of whom strain credulity. In Ireland he met Olivia Robertson, archpriestess and founder of the Fellowship of Isis, who, with her brother, an Anglican clergyman, performs mystery plays and rites in their castle's basement temple. In Cairo, Cott talked with Sekhmet Montu, leader of the Ammonites, a secret sect which claims to be a direct branch of ancient Egypt's religion; she maintains that her nine-year-old son Heru is an incarnation of the god-being Horus. Through interviews with Egyptologists, a New York artist steeped in Egyptian symbolism and a Canadian couple who are both psychologists and conduct Isis/Osiris workshops, Cott fathoms the myth's appeal to modern wisdom seekers.

If we can take this step, we may find we suffer from anger, fear and greed, but we may also discover the seeds of contentment and inner peace. Ayya Khema exhorts us to use awareness, reflection and meditation - the simple tools for change prescribed by the Buddha 2500 years ago. Training our mind in this way, we can release ourselves from the grip of negative emotions and enjoy the benefits of greater joy and confidence. The Buddha urged people to come and see for themselves the truth of his teachings - to test them in the fires of their own experience.

After graduating from Tisbury High School, he attended Tabor Academy and Middlebury College. He was hired as a waterfront reporter by the New Bedford Standard-Times on the day before the hurricane of 1938, which became the subject for his book A Wind to Shake the World. After enlisting in the US Navy, where he served in Europe and participated in D-Day, he returned to the Standard-Times, where he worked until his retirement in 1979. The author of seven books, Allen died in 1990.</p><h2>Narration and Knowledge</h2><p><p>Now in its third edition, <i>Narration and Knowledge</i> is a classic work exploring the nature of historical knowledge and its reliance on narrative. Analytical philosopher Arthur C. Danto introduces the concept of "narrative sentences," in which an event is described with reference to later events (for example, "the Thirty Years' War began in 1618") and discusses why such sentences cannot be understood until the later event happens (no one could have said in 1618 that "the Thirty Years' War began today"). Danto compares narrative and scientific explanation and explores the legitimacy of historical laws. He also argues that history is an autonomous and humanist discipline incapable of being reduced to scientific descriptions.</p><p>Lydia Goehr's new introduction illustrates Danto's main arguments by questioning her very role, first, as an introducer of a book that has not yet been read by readers and, second, as an interpreter of a book written forty years ago. Frank Ankersmit's conclusion revisits the initial impact of the publication of <i>Narration and Knowledge</i> and considers its enduring legacy.</p></p><p>Arthur C. Danto is Johnsonian Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Columbia University. His books include <i>The Philosophical Disenfranchisement of Art</i>, <i>Nietzsche as Philosopher</i> (both published by Columbia University Press), and <i>Art in the Historical Present</i>, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award.<p>"A substantial work which covers a wide range of philosophical problems about history, and indeed extends to a consideration of some logical features of our whole language of time. Philosophers will admire it for its lucidity and sophistication as well for the author's care and fertility of argument." -- <i>English Historical Review</i></p></p><h2>Landscapes of Cycling</h2><p>Bicycle races present some of the most dramatic action scenes in sports.

A first novel. (historical fiction).</p><p>When a white servant girl violates the order of plantation society, she unleashes a tragedy that exposes the worst and best in the people she has come to call her family.<p> Orphaned while onboard ship from Ireland, seven-year-old Lavinia arrives on the steps of a tobacco plantation where she is to live and work with the slaves of the kitchen house. Under the care of Belle, the master's illegitimate daughter, Lavinia becomes deeply bonded to her adopted family, though she is set apart from them by her white skin.</p><p> Eventually, Lavinia is accepted into the world of the big house, where the master is absent and the mistress battles opium addiction. Lavinia finds herself perilously straddling two very different worlds. When she is forced to make a choice, loyalties are brought into question, dangerous truths are laid bare, and lives are put at risk.</p><p> <i>The Kitchen House</i> is a tragic story of page-turning suspense, exploring the meaning of family, where love and loyalty prevail.</p><p> Explore the reading group guide for <i>The Kitchen House</i>. </p> <p><strong>A Conversation with Author Kathleen Grissom</strong><br><br> </p><p><b>Q:</b> What information surprised you while doing research on white indentured servants?<br><br> <b>A:</b> When I first began my research I was astonished to discover the great numbers of Irish that were brought over as indentured servants. Then, when I saw advertisements for runaway Irish indentured servants, I realized that some of them, too, must have suffered under intolerable conditions.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Why did you chose not to go into detail about some of the most dramatic plot points in the novel, for example, the death of Waters or the abuse of young Marshall?<br><br> <b>A:</b> For the most part, Lavinia and Belle dictated the story to me. From the beginning, it became quite clear that if I tried to embellish or change their story, their narration would stop. When I withdrew, the story would continue. Their voices were quite distinct. Belle, who always felt grounded to me, certainly did not hold back with description, particularly of the rape. Lavinia, on the other hand, felt less stable, less able to cope; and at times it felt as though she was scarcely able to relate her horror.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> It is interesting that your novel has two narrators--Lavinia and Belle. Do you have any plans to continue the story into the next generation--perhaps from the perspectives of Jaime and Elly?<br><br> <b>A:</b> In 1830, Jamie is a well-respected ornithologist in Philadelphia and Sukey is enslaved by the Cherokee Indians in North Carolina. Theirs are the two voices I hear. In time I will know if I am meant to tell their story. Presently I am writing Crow Mary, another work of historical fiction. A few years ago I was visiting Fort Walsh in the Cypress Hills of Saskatchewan. As I listened to an interpreter tell of Mary, who, in 1872, at the age of sixteen, was traded in marriage to a well-known fur trader, a familiar deep chill went thorough me. I knew then that I would return to write about this Crow woman. Some of her complex life is documented, and what fascinates me are her acts of bravery, equal, in my estimation, to those of Mama Mae.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> This is your first novel after diverse careers in retail, agriculture, and the arts. How have each of these experiences contributed to your writing style?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I don't know that any endeavor specifically contributed to my writing style, but I do know that every phase of my life helped prepare me to write this book.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> The dialogue of the slaves in this novel is very believable. It must have been a difficult thing to achieve. How did you go about creating authentic voices from two hundred years ago?<br><br> <b>A:</b> At the very beginning of my research I read two books of slave narratives: <em>Bullwhip Days: The Slaves Remember</em> and <em>Weevils in the Wheat: Interviews with Virginia Ex-Slaves</em>. Soon after, the voices from <i>The Kitchen House</i> began to come to me. My original draft included such heavy dialect that it made the story very difficult to read. In time I modified the style so the story could be more easily read.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> You said you wrote the prologue in one sitting after being inspired by a map you found while renovating an old plantation tavern. Since this is your first novel, do you think you were "guided" by residents of the past?<br><br> <b>A:</b> Not only do I feel I was guided but also that I was gifted with their trust. However, I am not alone in this. In Alice Walker's book <em>The Color Purple</em>, she writes: "I thank everybody in this book for coming. A.W., author and medium." Unless I misread that, I'd say, in this experience, I'm in good company.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Your book has been described as <i>"Gone with the Wind turned upside down."</i> Are you a fan of Margaret Mitchell's novel? Which writers have inspired you through the years?<br><br> <b>A:</b> I have only recently read <em>Gone with the Wind</em>. Although I did enjoy it, a few of the writers that have truly inspired me are Robert Morgan, Alice Randall, Susan Fromberg Schaeffer, Edward P. Jones, Nuala O'Faolain, Alexandra Fuller, Susan Howatch, Rick Bragg, Breena Clarke, Beryl Markham, Alice Walker, Joan Didion . . . this list could go on forever. I love to read.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> There are many characters in this novel. How did you go about choosing their names?<br><br> <b>A:</b> They were all taken from different lists of slaves that I found in my research.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> What advice do you have for writers working on their first novels?<br><br> <b>A:</b> If you feel called to write a book, consider it a gift. Look around you. What assistance is the universe offering you as support? I was given an amazing mentor, a poet, Eleanor Drewry Dolan, who taught me the importance of every word. To my utter amazement, there were times she found it necessary to consult three dictionaries to evaluate one word! Take the time you need to learn the craft. Then sit down and write. When you hand over your completed manuscript to a trusted reader, keep an open mind. Edit, edit, and edit again. And, of course, never give up! <b>Q:</b> At times in the novel, you can almost smell the hearty foods being prepared by Mama and others. In your research, did you find any specific notes or recipes from kitchen houses that you can share with your readers?<br><br> <b>A:</b> In 1737, William Byrd, founder of Richmond, wrote of the many types of fruits and vegetables available in Virginia. Watermelons, pumpkins, squashes, cucumbers, artichokes, asparagus, green beans, and cauliflower were all being cultivated. I discovered that many of these were preserved by pickling. For those interested in how this was done and for recipes from that time, an excellent resource is Martha Washington's Booke of Cookery and Booke of Sweetmeats, transcribed by Karen Hess.<br> While in Williamsburg, I watched re enactors roast beef over a spit in a kitchen fireplace. Small potatoes in a pan beneath the meat were browning in the drippings, and I cannot tell you how I longed for a taste. That was my inspiration for the Christmas meal. For basics, such as the chicken soup, I built a recipe around what I knew would have been available for use in the kitchen house at that time.<br> Whenever Belle baked a molasses cake, I craved a taste. I did try several old recipes that I found, but I was unsatisfied with the results. So, using the old recipes as a baseline, my daughter, Erin, and I created our own version of a simple yet moist and tasty molasses cake. I am happy to share it with the readers:</p><p> <b>Simple Molasses Cake</b><br> � cup butter<br> 1/3 cup packed brown sugar<br> 1 egg<br> � cup milk<br> 1 cup molasses<br> 2 cups flour<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1 teaspoon cinnamon<br> 2 dashes ground cloves<br> � teaspoon salt</p><p> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease an 8-inchsquare baking pan. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Beat in the egg. In a separate bowl, combine the milk and the molasses. In another bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and salt. Add each of these alternately to the butter mixture, beating well between additions. Spoon batter into the prepared pan. Bake for approximately 45 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.<br><br> </p>KATHLEEN GRISSOM, born and raised in Saskatchewan, is now happily rooted in south-side Virginia, where she and her husband live in the plantation tavern they renovated. <i>The Kitchen House</i> is her first novel.</p><h2>Moo Pak</h2><p>&nbsp;'This is the istry of Moo Pak,' writes a schoolboy, struggling with his<br>assignment as he sits in the Great Hall of Moor Park, now a secondary<br>school.

The ultimate loner. An elite ex-military cop who left the service years ago, he&#x2019;s moved from place to place...without family...without possessions...without commitments. And without fear. Which is good, because trouble&#x2014;big, violent, complicated trouble&#x2014;finds Reacher wherever he goes. And when trouble finds him, Reacher does not quit, not once...not ever. But some unfinished business has now found Reacher. And Reacher is a man who hates unfinished business. Ten years ago, a key investigation went sour and someone got away with murder. Now a chance encounter brings it all back. Now Reacher sees his one last shot. Some would call it vengeance. Some would call it redemption. Reacher would call it...justice.</p><p></p><p><b><i>The Enemy</i></b><br>Jack Reacher. Hero. Loner. Soldier. Soldier&#x2019;s son.

Turn a lawman into a renegade. And make him question words like honor, valor, and duty. For Jack Reacher, this is that case.... New Year&#x2019;s Day, 1990. The Berlin Wall is coming down. The world is changing. And in a North Carolina &#x201c;hot-sheets&#x201d; motel, a two-star general is found dead. His briefcase is missing. Nobody knows what was in it. Within minutes Jack Reacher has his orders: Control the situation. But this situation can&#x2019;t be controlled. Within hours the general&#x2019;s wife is murdered hundreds of miles away. Then the dominoes really start to fall.... Two Special Forces soldiers&#x2014;the toughest of the tough&#x2014;are taken down, one at a time. Top military commanders are moved from place to place in a bizarre game of chess. And somewhere inside the vast worldwide fortress that is the U.S. Army, Jack Reacher&#x2014;an ordinarily untouchable investigator for the 110th Special Unit&#x2014;is being set up as a fall guy with the worst enemies a man can have. But Reacher won&#x2019;t quit. He&#x2019;s fighting a new kind of war. And he&#x2019;s taking a young female lieutenant with him on a deadly hunt that leads them from the ragged edges of a rural army post to the winding streets of Paris to a confrontation with an enemy he didn&#x2019;t know he had. With his French-born mother dying&#x2014;and divulging to her son one last, stunning secret&#x2014;Reacher is forced to question everything he once believed...about his family, his career, his loyalties&#x2014;and himself.

She "wanted to sample, more democratically, the actual ground of literature." Casting herself into the untracked wilderness of the New York Society Library's stacks, she chose a shelf of fiction almost at random and read her way through it. Unsure of what she would find, she was nonetheless certain "that no one in the history of the world had read exactly this series of novels."<br>What results is a spirited experiment in "Off-Road or Extreme Reading." Rose's shelf of roughly thirty books has everything she could wish for&#x2015;a remarkable variety of authors and a range of literary ambitions and styles. The early-nineteenth-century Russian classic <i>A Hero of Our Time</i> by Mikhail Lermontov is spine by spine with <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> by Gaston Leroux. Stories of French Canadian farmers sit beside tales about aristocratic Austrians. California detective novels abut a novel from an Afrikaans writer who fascinates Rose to the extent that she ends up watching a YouTube video of his funeral.<br>Curious about the life of writers across a broad spectrum of time and space, with a keen interest in the challenges for literary women, Rose occasionally follows her reading with personal encounters. One of her favorite discoveries is the contemporary American novelist Rhoda Lerman, in whom she believes that she has found an unrecognized Grace Paley&#x2015;"another funny feminist humane earth-mother Jewish writer." But Lerman, who becomes a friend, turns out to be not "another" anything: in addition to writing she now raises prizewinning Newfoundlands and "talks of champion canines with the reverence I reserve for Alice Munro."<br>A joyous testament to the thrill of engagement with books high and low, <i>The Shelf</i> leaves us with the feeling that there are treasures to be found on every library or bookstore shelf. Rose investigates her own discoveries with exuberance, candor, and wit while exploring and relishing the centripetal nature of reading in the Internet age. Measuring her finds against her own inner shelf&#x2015;those texts that accompany her through life&#x2015;she creates an original and generous portrait of the literary enterprise.</p></p><p><p><b>Phyllis Rose</b> is the author of <i>A Woman of Letters: The Life of Virginia Woolf</i>; <i>Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages</i>; <i>Jazz Cleopatra: Josephine Baker in Her Time</i>; <i>The Year of Reading Proust: A Memoir in Real Time</i>; and two collections of essays.</p><i>One</i> <br>THE EXPERIMENT BEGINS <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>This book records the history of an experiment. Believing that literary critics wrongly favor the famous and canonical&#x2014;that is, writers chosen for us by others&#x2014;I wanted to sample, more democratically, the actual ground of literature. So I chose a fiction shelf in the New York Society Library somewhat at random&#x2014;it happens to be the LEQ&#x2013;LES shelf&#x2014;and set out to read my way through it, writing about the experience as I went. I had no reason to believe that the books would be worth the time I would spend on them. They could be dull, even lethally so. I was certain, however, that no one in the history of the world had read exactly this series of novels. That made the project exciting to me. <br>I thought of my adventure as Off-Road or Extreme Reading. To go where no one had gone before. To ski fresh powder in the backcountry of the Rockies. To hack through a Mexican jungle and discover a lost city. To be the first to cross Antarctica, reduced to eating the sled dogs, leading my men through the frozen wastes, across the Strait of Magellan, and over the treacherous mountains of South Georgia Island. To be the first. However, I like to sleep under a quilt with my head on a goose down pillow. So I would read my way into the unknown&#x2014;into the pathless wastes, into thin air, with no reviews, no bestseller lists, no college curricula, no National Book Awards or Pulitzer Prizes, no ads, no publicity, not even word of mouth to guide me. In the fifteenth century, Poggio Bracciolini, a Vatican secretary, spent his leisure time combing monastery libraries for texts of antiquity. He located them, copied them in his own beautiful hand or caused them to be copied, and made them known to other humanists. I read about Poggio in Stephen Greenblatt&#x2019;s <i>The Swerve</i>, and I envied that Renaissance geezer. I would have loved to spend weeks going through unexamined scrolls and codexes and to stumble upon Lucretius&#x2019;s masterpiece, <i>De Rerum Natura</i>, which no one had read in fifteen hundred years. This was my kind of exploration. <br>Usually we choose our reading from a preselected list of books, compiled by reviewers, awards panels, librarians, teachers, and professors, and these reading lists are remarkably resistant to change. Occasionally an intellectual movement comes along, feminism for one, that opens up our sense of what is major and what is minor, enlarging the pool of books read, but this does not happen often. And then the upstarts themselves have a way of becoming canonical, unquestioned, and a new generation considers <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> or <i>The Harder They Come</i> essential reading. What about all those books that are never read at all, never even considered? Who speaks for them? Arbitrary choice is the most radical response to conventional judgment. Let me, I thought, if only for a change, choose my reading almost blindly. Who knows what I will find? <br>Not all my friends saw the potential of this idea. How many books were on a shelf? Maybe thirty. How many writers? Maybe ten. &#x201c;So you will write about ten randomly chosen unknown writers?&#x201d; they said, smiling with feigned enthusiasm. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;Something more organic. It will be more like a travel journal.&#x201d; &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re going to discover a great writer who lived in obscurity without the recognition he or she deserved, right?&#x201d; Well, maybe, but that wasn&#x2019;t the point. <br>My generation was shaped by an approach to literature that began with the Romantics, was codified by Matthew Arnold, and reached its peak through a broad group of critics that included Lionel Trilling and F. R. Leavis. It believed that literature was an instrument of moral education. It imbued literature with depth and urgency, what we did not hesitate, as late as the 1960s, to call relevance to life. It believed that novelists and poets were special beings, &#x201c;unacknowledged legislators,&#x201d; people who taught and enlarged us. Through them we might investigate every important issue. No matter what future you imagined for yourself&#x2014;as a doctor, a lawyer, a banker, a cabaret singer&#x2014;engaging with literary texts in your student days would benefit you. Therefore, for a while, the study of literature moved to the center of the liberal arts curriculum. Many of us became &#x201c;English majors.&#x201d; <br>This approach had flaws, of course. It always risked becoming moralistic, and it elevated certain writers over others, writers whose works were considered especially meaningful. By the last quarter of the twentieth century, a reaction had set in. Any attempt to justify literature as giving the reader something became suspect. We had known for a long time not to seek a simple message in literature. But under the influence of French criticism, we were led to believe that there was nothing there at all. Everything we thought we saw in fiction, we ourselves brought to the text. A text was a culturally produced set of markers, no more, and the author&#x2019;s role in producing the text was very small. Nothing could be more ridiculous than to discuss what he or she was trying to say. That nothing lay at the heart of the literary experience&#x2014;no author-intended meaning or even set of concerns&#x2014;was, temporarily, refreshing. <br>We English majors, despite our military epithet, never understood that we had to fight for the literature we so much enjoyed. Its study seemed so well-entrenched, we took it for granted. When the Trojan horse arrived, in the form of clever, infinitely sophisticated professors of literature from France, we accepted their delicious gifts of irony, novelty, and nihilism and did not see the danger. Now, a generation later, the edifice that took a hundred years to put in place, and that spread a kind of enlightenment over America, is gone. We have to do all over again the work of proving that there is any point to reading a novel besides making time pass more quickly. This book is my way of making amends for not fighting when I should have. I thought the problem would go away if I waited, and eventually it did. But, as with a tsunami engulfing a city, when the waters receded, the city was gone. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>My project began with a storm. The entire Northeast was about to be hit by Hurricane Irene, which was expected to be historically destructive. I was vacationing in a rented house on Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard as we all waited, terrified, fearing we would be washed out to sea as people were by the hurricane of 1938. I searched my landlord&#x2019;s collection of books for appropriate reading and found it in <i>The Last Voyage of Columbus</i> by Martin Dugard. <br>Columbus was trying to locate the western passage to India when he arrived in the Caribbean on his fourth and last voyage. Superb seaman that he was, he sensed an extraordinary storm in the offing. He sought shelter in the harbor of Santo Domingo on the island of Hispaniola, but the governor, jealous of Columbus, found a reason not to let him bring his ships in. Columbus begged the governor to detain the treasure fleet that was about to set sail for Spain, but the governor would not do that either. Denied shelter in the harbor, Columbus led his ships northwest to relative safety and rode out the storm. The treasure fleet headed northeast, into the path of the hurricane, and no one survived. <br>This was perfect reading for a tense moment. As I was definitely on Columbus&#x2019;s side, I knew I would be safe. And so I was. Irene passed, doing no harm to New York or the Vineyard, though much to inland parts of New England. I was able to return to New York City, where I would spend the rest of the summer. <br>Two weeks after my return, hurricanes were still on my mind. The papers were still filled with hurricane news. I went to my local library to find <i>Hurricane</i>, a novel by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, recommended by a friend who knew I shared her enthusiasm for Nordhoff and Hall&#x2019;s <i>Mutiny on the Bounty</i>. My friend and her husband, dedicated readers, had set out to read everything Nordhoff and Hall had written and so had discovered <i>Hurricane</i>. I found the volume in the stacks, experiencing that rush you get when you find the title you want, and put it in my tote bag to check out. But at the same moment, I realized I had no desire to read it. I had had enough of hurricanes. <br>What, then, should I read? I was surrounded by thousands of books, but I had no reason to head toward one letter of the alphabet rather than another. <br>The library was the New York Society Library on East Seventy-ninth Street in New York, a magnificent lending library where one can browse in the stacks and take several books home to read at a time. Only members can check out books, but anyone can use the reference room and can become a member by paying a fee, currently $225 per year for one person or $275 for a household. This is the oldest library in New York, in existence since 1754, founded by a group of young men who believed that a library would help the city prosper. They called themselves the New York Society. To belong to the library is to join a self-selected family of readers stretching back to the Founding Fathers. George Washington borrowed books from this library&#x2014;and, some say, failed to return them. Later, Thoreau and Audubon, among others, roamed its hospitable stacks. Later still, Truman Capote and Willa Cather both used the library and became friends as a result. Originally in the Wall Street area, it moved uptown over the years, first to Leonard Street and Broadway, then to University Place off Union Square, and then, in 1937, to its current location on Seventy-ninth Street just off Madison Avenue, where it has become, with the 92nd Street Y, the greatest center of literary activity on the Upper East Side. <br>The building had been a private home, built in 1917 for the John S. Rogers family. The mansion was extensively reconfigured to become a library, but many of the original features survive&#x2014;the stately Renaissance Revival limestone fa�ade, the elegant stone staircase to the second floor, the coffered ceilings, the carved wooden arches. These give the building an aura of privilege and of Gilded Age splendor. At the back there are twelve floors of stacks to hold the collections and at the front, on the second floor, a gracious, light-filled room where a member can sit in a comfortable chair and read in quiet. From the moment the massive street doors open for me and I ascend the entrance stairs with their polished brass banister, I feel privileged. I have entered Edith Wharton&#x2019;s New York&#x2014;a grandfather clock opposite the checkout desk in the lobby, ancestors&#x2019; portraits in the stairwell. The Old Ones believed in dignifying the life of the mind with marble, murals, and mahogany, creating such grand spaces as the Widener Library at Harvard, the New York Public Library, and, on a more intimate scale, this jewel on Seventy-ninth Street. It may be the cheapest luxury in New York. <br>I was still standing in front of the books by Nordhoff and Hall, of which there was a huge number. As I looked around&#x2014;and this was only one of two floors in the stacks holding fiction&#x2014;I saw many long runs of books by one author. It was disconcerting. Often, I knew authors by only one book, as I had known Nordhoff and Hall by <i>Mutiny on the Bounty</i>. But each writer had spent a lifetime writing. What were the other books like? Who were all these scribblers whose work filled the shelves? Did they find their lives as writers rewarding? Who reads their work now? Are we missing out? I wonder if, at some point, all readers have the desire that I had then to consume everything in the library, but it is a desire no sooner formulated than felt to be impossible. One shelf, however, might be read, a part to stand for the whole. Even that would take time and perseverance. <br>Thus I came to the idea of choosing a shelf at random and reading my way through it to find what I would find. I suppose my friend&#x2019;s gallant and reckless gesture of reading everything by Nordhoff and Hall was in my mind. But the moment I had this idea I realized that wholly random would not do. If I whirled around and pointed to a shelf, it might be the shelf containing Nordhoff and Hall, which would contain little but Nordhoff and Hall&#x2014;or, if I moved down a few shelves, Kathleen Norris. So I created a rule: I would not read a shelf that contained more than four books by one author. This eliminated many shelves because writers, if they have any success, are unlikely to stop with four books. The shelves were filled with the work of writers who had published dozens: Stuart Woods, Sinclair Lewis, Louis L&#x2019;Amour, to say nothing of Trollope, Dickens, and Walter Scott. The inner stacks in the New York Society Library are nine shelves high, with eighteen of them per floor, six shelves wide, making 972 shelves on each floor. The outer walls have another 277 shelves. I sampled dozens without finding a shelf that held fewer than four books by one author. So I revised my rule. There had to be several authors represented on the shelf, and only one could have more than five books. Of those five I had to commit myself to reading only three. In addition, there had to be a mix of contemporary and older works, and one book had to be a classic I had not read and wanted to. <br>This mixture, too, was surprisingly difficult to find. Sometimes a shelf caught my eye, seeming, at first, varied and nicely balanced, but as I made my way from left to right, I found myself facing the monumental oeuvre of some vastly successful author of a century ago. Or I found a nicely balanced shelf, but there was no classic. Many shelves were filled with the popular entertainments, especially the detective stories, of another age. As for the entertainments of today, I had already read the ones I cared to. I had read almost every Elmore Leonard, Sarah Paretsky, and Alexander McCall Smith. This experiment was not about my learning to love Jodi Picoult or Danielle Steel, worthy as these writers may be. <br>As I surveyed shelf after shelf, I had to formulate other rules&#x2014;for example, I could choose no shelf that contained work by someone I knew. This was occasioned by a tempting <i>W</i> shelf that held five novels of Katharine Weber, who is a friend of mine and who is not, to my mind, widely enough known. It would give me the greatest pleasure to write about her work and explain its many virtues. But that would bias the project and also make me watch what I was saying more than I wanted to. So, no friends. <br>At last, after looking at perhaps two hundred shelves out of some thirteen hundred on this floor of the stacks (remember that fiction continues onto a second floor) I found a classic that I had not read and wanted to&#x2014;Lermontov&#x2019;s <i>A Hero of Our Time</i>. This seminal work in the history of the Russian novel, which I had managed to live my life without reading, shared a shelf with another book I had heard of as an English major but never read, <i>Gil Blas</i>, the granddaddy of picaresque fiction. There were also works by a writer called James LeRossignol, whose name intrigued me, and two books by an immensely prolific writer named William Le Queux, which had spilled over from a previous shelf and gave me the chance to sample this evidently popular Edwardian novelist. Visually, the shelf I had focused on was a pleasing mix of old-style bindings, gold-stamped library-bound hardcovers, and modern books whose colorful jackets were wrapped in Mylar. <br>I was hoping I had found the goal of my quest. But as I moved right, tracking titles with my finger, I came to a big block of books by the same author, old books in purple bindings with gold stamping. The author was Gaston Leroux, and one of his books was <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i>, but there were many, many others. To add to the problem, I coul...</p><h2>Light Years: Memoir of a Modern Lighthouse Keeper</h2><p><p>In 2007, Caroline Woodward was itching for a change. With an established career in book-selling and promotion, four books of her own and having raised a son with her husband, Jeff, she yearned for adventure and to re-ignite her passion for writing. Jeff was tired of piecing together low-paying part-time jobs and, with Caroline's encouragement, applied for a position as a relief lightkeeper on a remote North Pacific island. They endured lonely months of living apart, but the way of life rejuvenated Jeff and inspired Caroline to contemplate serious shifts in order to accompany him. When a permanent position for a lighthouse keeper became available, Caroline quit her job and joined Jeff on the lights.</p><br> <p>Caroline soon learned that the lighthouse-keeping life does not consist of long, empty hours in which to write. The reality is hard physical labour, long stretches of isolation and the constant threat of de-staffing. Beginning with a 3:30 a.m. weather report, the days are filled with maintaining the light station buildings, sea sampling, radio communication, beach cleanup, wildlife encounters and everything in between. As for dangerous rescue missions or dramatic shipwrecks--that kind of excitement is rare. "So far the only life I know I've saved is my own," she says, with her trademark dry wit. Yet Caroline is exhilarated by the scenic coastline with its drizzle and fog, seabirds and whales, and finds time to grow a garden and, as anticipated, write.</p><br> <p>Told with eloquent introspection and an eye for detail, <em>Light Years</em> is the personal account of a lighthouse keeper in twenty-first century British Columbia--an account that details Caroline's endurance of extreme climatic, interpersonal and medical challenges, as well as the practical and psychological aspects of living a happy, healthy, useful and creative life in isolation.</p></p><p><p>Caroline Woodward is the author of <em>Disturbing the Peace</em> (Polestar, 1990), which was nominated for the Ethel Wilson BC Book Prize, <em>Alaska Highway Two-Step</em> (Polestar, 1993), <em>Penny Loves Wade, Wade Loves Penny</em> (Oolichan, 2010) and two children's books that have also been nominated for many prizes. She lives on the Lennard Island Lightstation with her husband, Jeff George.</p><p>&#x201c;My only complaint about this book is--it was hard to put down...Caroline tells a great story with passion and conviction, and you will develop an appreciation for the men and women who work very hard to assure our safety and comfort while cruising.&#x201d;</p> (Mark Bunzel <i>Waggoner Cruising Guide</i>)<br><br><p>Review in the Waggoner Cruising Guide (online), July 7, 2016</p> (Mark Bunzel <i>Waggoner Cruising Guide</i>)</p><h2>Heavenly caves: reflections on the garden grotto</h2><p>This is the only single work devoted exclusively to the history of the garden grotto - the caves in landscape gardens that were artificially enhanced by waterfalls and ornamental delights to imitate, control and even surpass the effects of nature. Praised by writers from Pliny to Pope, the grotto has a rich and varied tradition: it originated as a motif in the classical world, where it was a ubiquitous feature imbued with mythological and oracular symbolism. Its popularity was renewed in the Renaissance gardens of the humanists, while its expressive effects achieved new heights with theatrical displays in the baroque nympheae of France and Italy, fanciful mazes in picturesque English landscapes, and melodramatic extravaganzas in the gardens of Wagnerian Germany. This miniature world was filled with fancy and mystery. Underground, the grotto was a source of nature&#39;s secrets, as well as those of the muses and nymphs. But it was also a sanctuary for men that inspired inner reflections as well as poetical communions with nature. Above all, the grotto was a museum in which men expressed their artistic understanding of nature and the cosmos.</p><p></p><h2>A Gathering of Days: A New England Girl&#39;s Journal, 1830-32</h2><p>As she keeps house for her widowed father and younger sister, thirteen-year-old Catherine begins her journal, unaware of the eventful year that lies ahead</p><p></p><h2>The Nine Guardians: A Novel</h2><p>The seven-year-old narrator shares her observances of her parents, a wealthy landowner and his wife, and a nurturing Indian servant who has cared for the girl and her brother since birth</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: SpanishCastellanos (1925-1974) has written a haunting novel set against the Mexican Revolution. She gives much of the narration over to a seven-year-old girl, who introduces characters simply yet vividly like a series of candid snapshots. The girl observes her rather remote parents--Cesar Arguello, a wealthy landowner whom she can describe only up to his knees, and his wife, who spends her time caring for a local hunchback so as to assure her place in heaven. Contrasted with them is Nana, the nurturing Indian servant who has cared for the girl and her younger brother, Mario, since birth. As the Indians rise up against the landowners and demand their rights, Castellanos suggests that the rest of society should do the same against the fetters of male supremacy. The author does not take sides between men and women, however; both are responsible for perpetuating the unhealthy state of their lives. Ultimately, while their father struggles to hold on to some scrap of the ranch for Mario's future, both children become the innocent victims of their moral and social inheritance. And Castellanos ( Another Way to Be: Selected Works of Rosario Castellanos ) paints it all with graceful, honest strokes. <p></p><p>Copyright 1992 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>MUSEUMS, OBJECTS, AND COLLECTIONS</h2><p>This book examines the historical context of museums, their collections, and the objects that form them.

For most people angiograms, coronary bypass surgery, balloon angioplasty, and cholesterol-lowering drugs are not effective and are completely unnecessary.

Hundreds of thousands of people each year are deceived in undergoing expensive medical treatments that do no good and may even do a great deal of harm. Highly effective procedures that are low-risk and inexpensive are ignored or even ridiculed.

He also argues that cholesterol isn't as major a factor in provoking heart attacks as it is made out to be, and that advertising and greed are among the main forces driving many drug companies and much of medical practice to say that it is. This isn't the ivory-tower spouting of a fanatic, for, whatever one may think of his satire and sarcasm, some of which is very clever, McGee knows the medical literature and thoroughly documents his points from the contents of reputable journals.

They strive for the pop socioeconomics of a David Brooks or a Malcolm Gladwell, but their heavy academic style may disenchant some readers before their thesis's more radical parts kick in. Over the last two centuries, they argue, an increasingly efficient economy, coupled with a rise in democratic thinking and growing access to information, has opened up life's possibilities to increasing numbers of people. Because participation in the consumption-based economy is unavoidable, the general public looks to markets to provide "deep support" in their quest for individualization, but "are routinely punished for being complex psychological individuals in a world still fitted out for the old mass order." This macroeconomic structure treats people as either employees or consumers and inevitably hurts their feelings. Zuboff and Maxmin would eliminate the "little murders" of customer service interaction by replacing the current transaction-based model with a form of "distributed capitalism" based on a customer-supplier relationship, so semi-anonymous customer service reps will be replaced by "advocates" fully emotionally involved in their clients' needs. It's not clear how society will make its way to the authors' dream of a fully automated lifestyle, or what life will be like for blue-collar workers and manual laborers. Pundits who celebrated the Internet's potential to thoroughly revolutionize the economy, however, will no doubt rally behind these impractical visions.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mary Poppins and the House Next Door</h2><p>When the new tenants in the house next to the Banks's home arrive, peace in the neighborhood leaves, and it is up to Mary Poppins to bring it back. Reprint. <i>SLJ. C. </i></p><p>P. L. TRAVERS (1899-1996) was a drama critic, travel essayist, reviewer, lecturer, and author of the &#39;Mary Poppins&#39; books. She wrote several other books for adults and children, but it is for the character of Mary Poppins that she is best remembered.Grade 3-6-- Mary Poppins fans will welcome this latest addition to the series. It features all of the favorite and familiar characters in a fast-paced fantasy/farce that works much better than Mary Poppins in Cherry Tree Lane (Delacorte, 1982). The neighbors are distressed to learn that their beloved Number Eighteen, an empty house for which each has created an imaginary, wished-for tenant, is about to be occupied by Mr. Banks' childhood governess, Miss Andrew--otherwise known as the Holy Terror. Her dreaded arrival brings a pleasant surprise as well, for Luti, a native boy from the South Seas, has accompanied her as both servant and student. Delighted by the prospect of a new friend, Jane and Michael are frustrated by the restrictions which the hypochondriacal Miss Andrew has placed on Luti, who grows more and more homesick for his family and tropical surroundings. When the call in his heart to return home becomes more than he can bear, it is Mary Poppins who makes the trip possible by means of a visit to the Man-in-the-Moon. The "noble savage" theme notwithstanding, Travers has written a satisfying story that skillfully combines the mundane with the magical in plot and sharp-as-ever characterization. Inscrutable, intimidating, incorrigible--all apply to Mary Poppins. Shepard's illustrations are both fresh and timeless. Her drawings of Miss Andrew are particularly telling, and with one look at Mary Poppins' upturned nose, children will almost hear her haughty sniff.<br><i>- Marie Orlando, Suffolk Cooperative Library System, Bellport, NY</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Third Girl (Poirot)</h2><p><p>Three single girls shared the same London flat.

She has been making up stories all her life. When she was twelve, her father handed her a copy of <i>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</i> and she realised that she wanted to be either Hercule Poirot or Agatha Christie when she grew up. When it occurred to her that she was never going to be able to grow her own spectacular walrus moustache, she decided that Agatha Christie was the more achieveable option. She spent her teenage years at Cheltenham Ladies' College, reading a lot of murder mysteries and hoping that she'd get the chance to do some detecting herself (she didn't).

At the end of the long drive, a three-story manor house sprawled along the crest of a rise, its bulk shining white in the clear winter moonlight, its numerous Palladian windows darkly shrouded except for two golden, lamplit casements on the main floor. From the base of the hill, stretching as far as the eye could see, fertile wheatfields lay dormant under a deep blanket of drifted snow. Dark fringes of forest rimmed the remote horizon of frozen steppe, and silhouettes of weeping willows bowed languidly over the icebound river cutting through the frosty, moon-drenched fields. All was crisp and still in the bitter December night.<br> &nbsp;<br> The clinking of mouthpieces and the faint jingle of spurs sounded softly as the horsemen moved up the avenue. Each man rode by instinct, half-asleep, exerting a knee pressure only sufficient to keep him in the saddle with the least effort. Heavy shubas of marten, sealskin, and beaver were crisscrossed with cartridge bandoleers and belted with double-holstered Mausers. Wolfskin or astrakhan papakhas, pulled low against the raw air, framed youthful faces and tired, cynical eyes which had seen savagery and bloodshed on an epic scale. Held slack in leather-gloved hands, reins slapped gently against sweat-streaked horseflesh. Half a verst back the thoroughbreds had smelled the stables, snorted, lifted their elegant noses, and of their own accord broken into a canter. Food and rest were near; the fatigued animals could sense it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Damned late to be bringing home twenty houseguests, Peotr,&#x201d; noted the young coronet keeping pace with the officer in the lead.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Kitty&#x2019;s used to it,&#x201d; his companion grunted laconically.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not in Piter1 anymore, Aliosha, and concerned with manners,&#x201d; someone behind them commented dryly. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a war on, remember?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;As if one could forget,&#x201d; a low-pitched murmur halfway down the ranks lamented. &#x201c;Bloody, depressing war.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But not in the last few weeks!&#x201d; cried a triumphant voice. &#x201c;We whipped their asses, by Christ! Two thousand roubles says those munitions depots we blew are still burning!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And five hundred more says Budenny&#x2019;s cavalry are still running toward Kamishin. Hip, hip&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hurrah!&#x201d; Twenty strong voices rose in exultant chorus to musingly finish the cheer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Seldom in the last months had they been able to rejoice so roundly. Since mid-October, Denikin&#x2019;s over-extended White Army had been in full retreat. Kolchak&#x2019;s Siberian armies were finished, and General Yudenich and his small body of volunteers from Estonia had been defeated at the gates of Petrograd. On October 20, the Reds had retaken Orel, the Ukraine had fallen, and now Kharlov was threatened. The Bolsheviks were proving to be formidable opponents.<br> &nbsp;<br> In spite of the recent disastrous reverses, General Mamontov had undertaken a deep raid behind Red lines. His cavalry mass, or koulak (fist), had smashed through the left flank of the Red Army and had reached Tambov, some 140 miles from where he had first broken through, then had turned westward and had moved along a zigzag route, dodging large Red troop concentrations for well over a hundred miles before turning back south and rejoining the main lines of the White armies. In the course of his daring raid, Mamontov had completely disrupted the rear of a wide sector of the Red front. He burned army supplies and depots, blew up bridges, destroyed locomotives and rolling stock, and executed captured Bolshevik commissars.2 Cheerful jubilation in the South Russian newspapers noted there hadn&#x2019;t been anything remotely like it since the cavalry raids during the American Civil War half a century earlier.<br> &nbsp;<br> The officers cantering up the snow-covered driveway had been part of that roving cavalry under Mamontov. They were one of the special cavalry units from Turkestan and the Caucasus incorporated into Mamontov&#x2019;s IV Cavalry Corps; members of the Touz�mnaya (Native) Division, unofficially known throughout Russia as the Dikaya (Savage) Division. They were regarded, by others as well as themselves, as the elite of the White Army divisions. Their outward appearance was at best irregular. Flamboyant riffraff of every race and creed was the polite description. Some called them a pack of killers. Whatever the definition, all acknowledged their incredible skill and bravery, as well as their remarkable loyalty to each other, which went well beyond the usual standards of courage. They never left their dead or wounded on the battlefield but brought them out regardless of the circumstances.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although young, all had served a bloody apprenticeship in the Great War and there had learned to cast aside everything not essential to battle: idealism, military discipline, regulation equipment, tack, and polish. They were unorthodox in every way&#x2014;even to a completely different style of riding. It was a style more sporting than military, for they all rode thoroughbreds on short stirrups with a long rein and no bits, enabling them to keep up a pace that no one else could rival. The riders had a variety of nagaikis (whips) and kinjals (knives) tucked into their boots which they used with a kind of effective carelessness that earned them their reputation for savageness.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That Balashov arsenal was sheer beauty, Apollo,&#x201d; said a hawk-faced Kurdistan dressed in sheepskin, leather, and silver-embroidered breeches to the tall, well-built rider slouched in the saddle of the magnificent Karabagh mare cantering alongside him. &#x201c;But crazy, definitely crazy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can count on Leda to get me out of any tight spot,&#x201d; the large man impassively replied. &#x201c;A mullah once told me Leda and I were both touched by the sun&nbsp;...&nbsp;some mystical sort of thing. Not that I believe it, particularly, but it doesn&#x2019;t hurt. I&#x2019;ll take all the luck I can get.&#x201d; Mystical or not, it was an apt description, for the spectacular golden color of the mare and her master&#x2019;s pale yellow hair&#x2014;unseen at the moment, beneath the wolfskin papakha pulled down over his forehead&#x2014;was a superb match.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Touched is right,&#x201d; his companion remarked facetiously, referring neither to mysticism nor coloring. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a damned maniac, Apollo, going in to blow up that guarded arsenal smack in the middle of Budenny&#x2019;s army.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hell, I couldn&#x2019;t let an opportunity like that pass. Damn nice fireworks&#x2014;good for night riding.&#x201d; An inner smile briefly lit hooded eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was like a full moon over the Erivan plateau....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d appreciate it, Sinko, brigandism being in your soul and all. Reminded you of the night raids so dear to your heart, eh?&#x201d; There was a teasing mockery in the timbre of the deep voice.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nostalgic as mother&#x2019;s milk, my friend.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;As you damn well know&#x201d;&#x2014;the muscle in one lean cheek clenched momentarily&#x2014;&#x201c;it doesn&#x2019;t hurt to be a maniac, fighting this war. All the truly rational men were done in long ago. And as for dealing with unpredictable situations and explosives&nbsp;...&#x201d; Throwing off the brief melancholy, the negligent drawl was restored: &#x201c;Dare I make the clich� comparison to women? Handle them with a delicate touch and they&#x2019;ll all make you feel good in the end.&#x201d; Turning his head slightly, he smiled at Sinko in that lazy, faintly ironic way that was so much a part of his character.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You should know, Apollo,&#x201d; the dark-skinned, showily dressed Kurd replied with a flash of white teeth. &#x201c;Wherever we stop there&#x2019;s some woman giving you the eye and more than willing to make room for you in her bed that night.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;War&#x2019;s like that, Sinko. Take it while you can. Who knows if you&#x2019;ll live to see morning.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sinko glanced at the man riding next to him, expecting to see the familiar teasing smile.

The city is controlled by boss Royal Beaumont, who took it by force many years ago and has held it against all comers since. </p><p>Now his domain is being threatened by an invading crime syndicate. But in a town where crime and politics are virtually indivisible, there are other players awaiting their turn onstage. Emmett Till&#x2019;s lynching has inflamed a nascent black revolutionary movement. A neo-Nazi organization is preparing for race war. Juvenile gangs are locked in a death struggle over useless pieces of "turf." And some shadowy group is supplying them all with weapons. With an IRA unit and a Mafia family also vying for local supremacy, it&#x2019;s no surprise that the whole town is under FBI surveillance. But that agency is being watched, too. </p><p>Beaumont ups the ante by importing a hired killer, Walker Dett, a master tactician whose trademark is wholesale destruction. But there are a number of wild cards in this game, including Jimmy Procter, an investigative reporter whose tools include stealth, favor-trading, and blackmail, and Sherman Layne, the one clean Locke City cop, whose informants range from an obsessed "watcher" who patrols the edge of the forest, where cars park for only one reason, to the madam of the county&#x2019;s most expensive bordello. But Layne is guarding a secret of his own, one that could destroy more than his career. Even the most innocent are drawn into the ultimate-stakes game&#x2013;like Tussy Chambers, the beautiful waitress whose mystically deep connection with Walker Dett might inadvertently ignite the whole combustible mix. </p><p>In a stunning departure from his usual territory, Andrew Vachss gives us a masterful novel that is also an epic story of postwar America. Not since Dashiell Hammett&#x2019;s Red Harvest has there been as searing a portrait of corruption in a small town. This is Vachss&#x2019;s most ambitious, innovative, and explosive work yet.</p></p><h2>A Stitch in Crime (A Hatti Lehtinen Mystery)</h2><p>A Hatti Lehtinen Mystery Hoping to increase tourism, the residents of Red Jacket, Michigan, are gearing up for the St. Lucy&#x2019;s Day parade and the Pikkujoulu (Little Christmas) festival. When the coveted title of Saint Lucy goes to outsider Liisa Pelonen, folks in the close-knit town are riled. But no one anticipates violence, especially not temporary police chief Hatti Lehtinen, owner of the Bait &amp; Stitch shop. So it is a distinct shock when Liisa&#x2019;s lifeless body turns up.</p><p>Yost provides an entertaining combination of mystery and romance with a dose of Finnish tradition. <br><br>Being the temporary police chief of Red Jacket, Michigan, is no sinecure. Hatti Lehtinen, separated from her lawyer husband, Jace Night Wind, is running a combination bait and knitting shop. When her stepfather is hospitalized, she takes on his job, never expecting a murder. The town, with its mostly Finnish heritage, is buzzing with preparations for Pikkujoulu, a pre-Christmas festival that may win them a stop on the Christmas train, which would be a welcome boost for the moribund local economy. Heading the effort is Hatti's stepfather's best friend, childless funeral director Arvo Maki, who has made a major mistake and several enemies by naming Liisa Pelonen, a beautiful young girl he and his wife took in, as the yearly parade's St. Lucy. When Liisa is found dead in the Makis' sauna, Hatti steps up to investigate. Suddenly Jace arrives on her doorstep, responding to a call from his grandfather Chief Joseph, who told him that his younger brother Reid had been involved with Liisa. Jace insists that Reid is innocent even though he has a record. Sparks fly as the estranged couple is forced to work together to prove Reid's innocence. Even though the doting Makis thought she was perfect, Liisa was far from popular. It turns out that she was pregnant, in line to inherit several million dollars and planning to leave Red Jacket. Given so many perfectly good motives for murder, Hatti has her hands full. Yost (For Better or Hearse, 2012) provides an entertaining combination of mystery and romance with a dose of Finnish tradition. --Kirkus Review<br><br>The Nordic background will appeal to those who enjoy Kathleen Ernst s Chloe Ellefson mysteries, which also concern Norwegian Americans.<br><br>Hoping to increase tourism, the residents of Red Jacket, Michigan, on the Keweenaw Peninsula, are gearing up for the St. Lucy s Day parade and the Pikkujoulu (Little Christmas) festival, events designed to earn the town a stop on the Keweenaw Snow Train. When town father Arvo Maki picks his prot�g�, Liisa Pelonen, as this year s St. Lucy, bypassing the traditional method of choosing a young woman for the coveted position, he angers many in the town. When Liisa is found dead, acting police chief Hatti Lehtinen investigates. However, Hatti, owner of Bait &amp; Stitch, the local fishing and knitting shop, is quickly out of her depth and enlists the aid of her sister, cousin, and good friend, along with her estranged husband, Jace Night Wind, whose half-brother is the prime suspect. Details of Finnish culture and small-town life frame Hatti s investigation, related in the first person. The Nordic background will appeal to those who enjoy Kathleen Ernst s Chloe Ellefson mysteries, which also concern Norwegian Americans. --Booklist Review</p><h2>Nemesis: The Death Star</h2><p>The founder of the once-dismissed theory that a star orbits the sun and barrages the earth with meteors every twenty six million years, creating a wide range of phenomena, discusses the genesis, discovery, and substantiation of his work</p><p></p><h2>Alliums: The Ornamental Onions</h2><p>Though it has many vibrant and elegant plants, this genus is often valued only for its edible species.

A series of bombings at embassies, consulates and U.N. delegation offices in the U.S. over the last five years is the work of someone the feds and the San Francisco police call the Diplo-bomber. A $1-million reward has been offered, and Sharon signs on with the slick security office of RKI, where her boyfriend Hy Ripinski is loosely connected, to investigate. Recently targeted is the local consulate of Azad, a small Arab emirate; during an interview with the woman consul general, Sharon meets her granddaughter Habiba, whose isolated loneliness reminds Sharon of her own childhood. Unmet is Habiba's father, who disappeared years before, apparently after getting in gambling trouble. More bombings, a murder and a kidnapping lead Sharon to a small Caribbean island, a dramatic late-night rescue and then a desperate flight from Miami to California as she tries to stay a step ahead of the kidnappers. The Diplo-bomber case promises more violence and, not incidentally, craters the career of a policewoman friend before its resolution. A mellow, engaging and determined Sharon here heads a diverse and intriguing supporting cast, notably members of the family that once owned the island.

Sharon McCone is grappling with world-weariness, approaching the "big four-oh," and lamenting the distance she's traveled from her innocent early days at All Souls Legal Co-op. But even a midlife crisis doesn't stop McCone from getting involved in the case of the "Diplo Bomber," a terrorist who has maimed or killed half a dozen foreign diplomats. San Francisco homicide cop Adah Joslyn enlists McCone's help when the bomber warns that his next target will be the San Francisco^-based consulate of Azad, an oil-rich Arab emirate. But it's not until McCone meets the engaging nine-year-old granddaughter of the Azad consul that she gets hooked. The case is as puzzling and frustrating as any she's worked on, taking her from San Francisco's seamy underworld to the sparkling beauty of a remote Caribbean island. And just when McCone thinks she's finally figured out who the bomber is, even <i>she</i>'s surprised by one final, macabre twist.

She is acclaimed as &#39;awesomely intelligent&#39; (Guardian) and &#39;a writer of breathtaking clarity&#39; (The Spectator). With www.JancisRobinson.com (subscribers in nearly 100 countries) and her flock of Twitter followers, she is something of an online pioneer as a wine communicator. She makes frequent visits to the USA to stay ahead of the crowd and, in the early 1980s, was the first British journalist to take a serious interest in American wine.Robinson, author of The Great Wine Book ( LJ 2/1/83 ), approaches wine in this book by examining the nearly 1000 varieties of grapes used by winemakers around the world. Maps of major wine producing regions show the international distribution of grapevine varieties. More detailed maps and descriptions of great vineyards illustrate the effects of climate and geography on the selection of grapevines. Descriptions of 9 "classic" and 28 "major" vine varieties present qualitative and quantitative assessments of the most popular grapes. A country by country listing of less popular varieties adds information about the taste and status of hundreds of unique wine grapes. This is an important and accessible book for wine connoisseurs.

But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard "accidentally" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. <p> As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.

Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort. <br>Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the Azkban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, "He's at Hogwarts...he's at Hogwarts." <br>Harry Potter isn't safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his friends. Because on top of it all, there may well be a traitor in their midst.</p><h2>Wintering: A Novel of Sylvia Plath</h2><p><br>This is the story of a woman forging a new life for herself after her marriage has foundered, shutting up her beloved Devonshire house and making a home for her two young children in London, elated at completing the collection of poems she foresees will make her name. It is also the story of a woman struggling to maintain her mental equilibrium, to absorb the pain of her husband's betrayal and to resist her mother's engulfing love. It is the story of Sylvia Plath.<br><br>In this deeply felt novel, Kate Moses recreates Sylvia Plath's last months, weaving in the background of her life before she met Ted Hughes through to the disintegration of their relationship and the burst of creativity this triggered. It is inspired by Plath's original ordering and selection of the poems in Ariel, which begins with the word 'love' and ends with 'spring,' a mythic narrative of defiant survival quite different from the chronological version edited by Hughes. At Wintering's<i> </i>heart, though, lie the two weeks in December when Plath finds herself still alone and grief-stricken, despite all her determined hope. With exceptional empathy and lyrical grace, Moses captures her poignant, untenable and courageous struggle to confront not only her future as a woman, an artist and a mother, but the unbanished demons of her past.<br><br></p><p>This engrossing debut novel depicts Sylvia Plath's feverish artistic process in the bitter aftermath of her failed marriage to Ted Hughes--the few excruciating yet astoundingly productive weeks in which she wrote Ariel," her defining last collection of poems. <br>In December 1962, shortly before her suicide, Plath moved with her two children to London from the Hughes's home in Devon. Focusing on the weeks after their arrival, but weaving back through the years of Plath's marriage, Kate Moses imagines the poet juggling the demands of motherhood and muse, shielding her life from her own mother, and by turns cherishing and demonizing her relationship with Ted. Richly imagined yet meticulously faithful to the actual events of Plath's life, Wintering is a remarkable portrait of the moments of bravery and exhilaration that Plath found among the isolation and terror of her depression&#x201c;Beautiful and moving. . . .

In 1956, at the time of the Hungarian revolution, he and his wife escaped to the West, where he lived in New York until his death in 1968.A hopeful book about the Holocaust is a rare find. Billionaire financier George Soros, the author's son, is known for his optimistic, bold philanthropical support of open societies in post-Communist Eastern Europe. After reading this sober but surprisingly cheerful memoir, it's clear where George got these traits. Few Holocaust memoirs begin with statements like "Life is beautiful and full of variety and adventure. But luck must be on your side." But survival took wiles and connections as well. As life worsened for Hungarian Jews in 1944, Soros, a Budapest lawyer, managed to find false Christian papers and hiding places for his family. The Soroses struggled daily against possible discovery and death. Soros relates the fascinating details of his search for hiding places and skilled document forgers. The book's remarkable, upbeat tone predominates: even as Hungary falls to homegrown fascists and his acquaintances are killed, Soros views his travails as a game he will win. The book is a tribute to the power of the individual to maneuver through devastating, dangerous circumstances. Originally published in Esperanto in 1965 (the author died in 1986), the book was recently rediscovered by Paul Soros's daughter-in-law. Those interested in the Holocaust and in the psychology of survival will find it compelling, as will those seeking inspiration. Eight pages b&amp;w photos not seen by PW. (Sept.) Forecast: Name-recognition and national TV and radio interviews will jump-start the 25,ooo-copy first printing, and the book's genuine appeal will sustain respectable sales.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Poverty And Compassion: The Moral Imagination of the Late Victorians</h2><p>Examines the work and thought of reformers, social critics, and philanthropists in late-nineteenth-century England to provide insights into how poverty was regarded</p><p>&#34;A monumental achievement. &#34;--Wall Street JournalThis is a source book for anyone trying to think about how to make a difference in inner-city America.

Nor did she aspire to become one of the most hated people on Earth&#x2014;or off Earth, technically&#x2014;but which of us has control over our destiny?</p> <p>Most of us do have more control. It was Carmen's impulsiveness that brought her both distinctions.</p> <p>Her parents dragged her off to Mars when she was eighteen, along with her younger brother Card. The small outpost there, which some called a colony, had decided to invite a shipload of families.</p> <p>A shitload of trouble, some people said. None of the kids were under ten, though, and most of the seventy-five people living there, in inflated bubbles under the Martian surface, enjoyed the infusion of new blood, of young blood.</p> <p>On the way over from Earth, about halfway through the eight-month voyage, Carmen had a brief affair with the pilot, Paul Collins. It was brief because the powers-that-be on Mars found out about it immediately, and suggested that at thirty-two, Paul shouldn't be dallying with an impressionable teenaged girl. Carmen was insulted, feeling that at nineteen she was not a "girl" and was the only one in charge of her body.</p> <p>The first day they were on Mars, before they even settled into their cramped quarters, Carmen found out that the "powers"-that-be were one single dour power, administrator Dargo Solingen. She obviously resented Carmen on various levels and proceeded to make the Earth girl her little project.</p> <p>It came to a head when Dargo discovered Carmen swimming, skinny-dipping, after midnight in a new water tank. She was the oldest of the six naked swimmers, and so took the brunt of the punishment. Among other things, she was forbidden to visit the surface, which was their main recreation and escape, for two months.</p> <p>She rankled under this, and rebelled in an obvious way: when everyone was asleep, she suited up and went outside alone, which broke the First Commandment of life on Mars, at the time: Never go outside without a buddy.</p> <p>She'd planned to go straight out a few kilometers, and straight back, and slip back into her bunk before anyone knew she was gone. It was not to be.</p> <p>She fell through a thin shell of crust, which had never happened before, plummeted a couple of dozen meters, and broke an ankle and a rib. She was doomed. Out of radio contact, running out of air, and about to freeze solid.</p> <p>But she was rescued by a Martian.</p> <br><br> <p><b>3 </b></p> <p><b>GERM THEORY </b></p> <p>Humans call me Fly-in-Amber, and I am the "Martian" best qualified to tell the story of how we made contact with humans.</p> <p>I will put Martian in quotation marks only once. We know we are not from Mars, though we live here. Some of the humans who live here also call themselves Martians, which is confusing and ludicrous.</p> <p>We had observed human robot probes landing on Mars, or orbiting it, for decades before they started to build their outpost, uncomfortably close to where we live, attracted by the same subterranean (or subarean) source of water as those who placed us here, the Others.</p> <p>With more than a century to prepare for the inevitable meeting, we had time to plan various responses. Violence was discussed and discarded. We had no experience with it other than in observation of human activities on radio, television, and cube. You would kick our asses, if we had them, but we are four-legged and excrete mainly through hundreds of pores in our feet.</p> <p>The only actual plan was to feign ignorance. Not admit (at first) that we understood many human languages. You would eventually find out we were listening to you, of course, but you would understand our need for caution.</p> <p>We are not good at planning, since our lives used to be safe and predictable, but in any case we could not have planned on Carmen Dula. She walked over the top of a lava bubble that had been worn thin, and fell through.</p> <p>She was obviously injured and in grave danger. Our choices were to contact the colony and tell them what had happened or rescue her ourselves. The former course had too many variables&#x2014;explaining who we were and what we knew and all; she would probably run out of air long before they could find her. So our leader flew out to retrieve her.</p> <p>(We have one absolute leader at a time; when he/she/it dies, another is born. More intelligent, larger, stronger, and faster than the rest of us, and usually long-lived. Unless humans interfere, it turns out.)</p> <p>The leader, whom Carmen christened Red, took a floater out and picked up Carmen and her idiot robot companion, called a dog, and brought them back to us. Our medicine cured her broken bones and frostbite.</p> <p>We are not sure why it worked on her, but we don't know how it works on us, either. It always has.</p> <p>We agreed not to speak to her, for the time being. We only spoke our native languages, which the human vocal apparatus can't reproduce. Humans can't even hear the high-pitched part.</p> <p>So Red took her back to the colony the next night, taking advantage of a sandstorm to remain hidden. Left her at the air-lock door, with no explanation.</p> <p>It was very amusing to monitor what happened afterward&#x2014;we do listen to all communications traffic between Earth and Mars. Nobody wanted to believe her fantastic story, since Martians do not and could not exist, but no one could explain how she had survived so long. They even found evidence of the broken bones we healed but assumed they were old injuries she had forgotten about, or was lying about.</p> <p>We could have had years of entertainment, following their tortuous logic, but illness forced our hand.</p> <p>All of us Martians go through a phase, roughly corresponding to the transition between infancy and childhood, when for a short period our bodies clean themselves out and start over. It isn't pleasant, but neither is it frightening, since it happens to everybody at the same time of life.</p> <p>Somehow, Carmen "caught" it from us, which is medically impossible. Our biologies aren't remotely related; we don't even have DNA. Nevertheless, she did have the transition "sickness," and we brought her back to our home and treated her the way we would a Martian child, having her breathe an unpleasant mixture of smoldering herbs. She expelled everything, especially the two large cysts that had grown in her lungs.

Our leader Red and a healer Martian went over to the human colony and treated all the children the way they had Carmen, not pleasant but not dangerous. Unfortunately, no one could explain how the "disease" could have been transmitted from us to Carmen and from Carmen to the children. Human scientists were mystified, and, of course, we don't have scientists as such.</p> <p>The children seemed to be all right. But people were afraid that something worse might happen, and so the humans on Earth put all of Mars under quarantine, where they remain to this day, although there have been no other incidents.

His family lived on a farm in Pennsylvania for several years then returned to Elmira until Tedd was ten years old. His father's work then required that they move to Gainesville, Florida. There, Tedd's first art lessons in an abandoned dentist's office over the Happy Hour pool hall eventually led to a fine arts degree from the University of Florida. He and his wife, Carol, started their family in Tallahassee where Tedd worked as a commercial illustrator. Carol, a Kindergarten teacher, drew Tedd's attention to children's books. Their first son, Walter, inspired his breakthrough picture book, <i>No Jumping on the Bed!</i>. His second son, William, now stars in <i>No More Water in the Tub!</i>, a sequel to his first book. He has now published more than 30 books as author and illustrator. When not working on his books, Tedd's interests include tennis, sketching, reading, coin collecting, and the computer.<p>"The inspiration to begin writing and illustrating for children came from my wife, Carol. As a kindergarten teacher, she collected picture books. I was attracted to their colorful pages and the way the words and pictures played with each other, much like the captioned cartoons I had drawn when I was young.</p><p>"Perhaps the biggest surprise of my career as an author is that I'm now going back to elementary school! Visiting young readers in classrooms and libraries is something I love. Kids keep me on my toes and they ask a lot of questions. The number one question seems to be, 'Where do you getyour ideas?' It's also the hardest question to answer because every idea is different. Some ideas seem to pop out of thin air -- while I'm in the shower or walking the dog. Others come from reading or research. But most of my ideas come from my family and the things they do and say.</p><p>"For instance, one time when my first son, Walter, was five years old, I found him lying on the couch, looking pale as a ghost and clutching a Bible to his chest. He was praying! When I asked what was wrong, he wouldn't answer. In fact, he wouldn't even open his mouth. My wife, Carol, finally coaxed a response from him: he pointed inside his mouth. Carol exclaimed, 'You have a loose tooth!' Walter's eyes nearly popped out with fright. We quickly assured him that it was perfectly okay for his tooth to come loose and that a new one would replace it. But Carol and I looked at each other and realized that despite all our efforts to be good parents, we had somehow completely forgotten to warn Walter that teeth fall out! He had thought he was falling apart! I made a little note in my journal; then ten years later, I expanded that memory into my book <i>Parts</i>."</p><p>Tedd Arnold lives in Elmira, New York, with his wife, Carol, two sons, Walter and William, two cats, Cody and Frankie, and one dog, Hershey.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Grade 1-4&#x2013;Fourteen artists present their mostly visual answers to the age-old question in two-page illustrations done in various mediums and styles. Words are at a minimum; the pictures speak for themselves. Marla Frazee's solution is simple, showing a brown hen hurrying from a plain wooden coop pelted by rain to a colorful, palacelike haven surrounded by blue sky (a thought bubble reads: duh). In Mo Willems's scene, a nervous fowl responds to a grilling by angry police officers by swearing that she crossed just...to get to the other side! Honest! Meanwhile, the heat is on, as a cop prepares a barbecue in the background. Judy Schachner's plump black chicken that foolishly heads to a dinner date with two hungry foxes, ...wasn't just free-range...she was de-ranged! Jerry Pinkney's familiar Little Red Hen goes over to attend a tea party with her friends, while Harry Bliss's cartoon critter runs away from mutated zombie chickens from Mars! An equally funny section entitled Why Did the Artist Cross the Road? provides the illustrators' responses along with brief lists of their works. It's not often that one title is filled with such talent and such child appeal.

Powys&#39;s rich iconography interwea</p><p>John Cowper Powys (1872-1963) lived in the United States as well as his native England.&nbsp; The author of ten novels, including <b>A Glastonbury Romance</b>, <b>Weymouth Sands</b>, and <b>Maiden Castle</b>, as well as many works of criticism and philosophy, he was the son of a vicar and a descendant of the poets Donne and Cowper.A major English novelist of the 1920s and '30s, Powys's remarkable novels are reprinted from time to time (Harper recently did Weymouth Sands). The present edition marks a long-overdue return to availability of what is certainly his masterwork. Glastonbury is a small town in Somerset that by legend was home to King Arthur, and some of its ruins are infused with the spirit of long-gone ideals like the Holy Grail. Building on that base, Powys has constructed a towering edifice of faith, greed and cynicism, as a wealthy industrialist tries to exploit the town's mines, a skeptic cynically plans to bring in money by exploiting the legends and many people of varying degrees of faith and idealism are caught in between. Powys's gifts are enormous: he has an eye for nature, and its mystical power, akin to Wordsworth's; his sense of rustic scene and character is the equal of Hardy; his sharp-eyed view of business and politics reminds one of Shaw; and his sense of the endless subtleties of the relationships between men and women is, if anything, more encompassing than D. H. Lawrence's. His leisurely tale is told in prose that ranges from poetic miniatures to extended passages of the most dazzling rhetoric. It's a long book that requires the closest attention; but those who fall under its spell will be rewarded by one of this century's masterpieces of the novel. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Victorian Lace Crochet: 38 Exquisite Designs for the Home</h2><p>SOFTCOVER</p><p></p><h2>Mrs. Appleyard&#39;s summer kitchen (Their The Mrs. Appleyard books ; v. 2)</h2><p>From Mrs. Appleyard&#39;s Summer Kitchen (the second volume in this series) comes a glorious procession of picnic and party dishes from May through October -- traditional and original cooking to accompany the summer round of outdoor and indoor life with family and friends.</p><p></p><h2>The Dynasts (Papermacs)</h2><p><p>This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

However, John&#x2019;s mother, Elizabeth, an avid sailor, found the idea of an adventure at sea exciting and set out to help him get his Seaman&#x2019;s Papers. When John was sworn in, he was given one piece of advice: to not tell the crew that his father was a United States senator.<br><br>The job ticket read &#x201c;forty-five days from Camden, New Jersey, to the Mediterranean on the<i> Rose City,</i>&#x201d; a supertanker. As the ship sailed the orders changed, and forty-five days became four months across the equator, around Africa, across the Indian Ocean, and up to Japan&#x2014;a far more perilous voyage than John or his mother had imagined. The physical labor was grueling, and outdated machinery aboard the ship, including broken radar, jeopardized the lives of the crew. They passed through the Straits of Malacca three times, with hazardous sailing conditions and threats of pirates. But it was also the trip of a lifetime: John reveled in the natural world around him, listened avidly to the tales of the old timers, and even came to value the drunken camaraderie among men whose only real family was one another. A talented artist, John drew what he saw and kept a journal on the ship that he turned into his senior thesis when he returned to Wesleyan the following year.<br><br>A few years after John died in his early forties, the result of a reaction to acetaminophen, his mother printed a limited edition of his journal illustrated with drawings from his notebooks. Encouraged by the interest in his account of the voyage, she agreed to publish the book more widely. An honestly written story of a boy&#x2019;s coming into manhood at sea, <i>The</i> <i>Voyage of the Rose City</i> is a taut, thrilling tale of the adventure of a lifetime.</p><p><b>John Moynihan</b> was born in Syracuse, New York, and lived with his family in India for two years during middle school. That experience, and the travels that went with it, set him on a lifelong quest to see the wider world. He worked as a writer and animator and loved teaching as he traveled, always returning to New York City, his home base.Part I<br> YOU'RE NOT PAID TO THINK!<br><br> Chapter 1<br><br> The call came in at midnight. One of the 12-4 watch banged on my door and gave me the word: all hands on deck to let go in forty minutes. Within fifteen the crew had assembled in the lounge on A deck. The Bosun shuttled back and forth between the bridge and the main deck, straightening out the logistics and trying to encourage a crew that was already tired and restless. This was it-within a couple of hours, all twenty-seven of the current crew of the SS Rose City would be committed to an overseas voyage, and only the executive board of the company sitting in the bidding room in Seattle could really say for how long.<br><br> The 8-12 and 12-4 watches disappeared down the aft stairway to work the stern. The 4-8 watch (Billy, Jake, and me) and the Bosun shuffled down the main passageway and headed for the bow. The quarter-mile walk from the house to the bow took about five minutes. Along the way Billy and Jake briefed me on the job that lay ahead. More important, they told me how to write it up on the overtime sheet. "Every minute counts. Take 'em for all you can get. Snatch it up!" Jake would say, grabbing as if to lift J. Paul Getty&#x2019;s wallet.<br><br> Waiting for us on the bow was the chief mate, a tall, overweight man who wielded his walkie-talkie for all the command it could garner him. He and the Bosun conferred in authoritative tones at one end of the foredeck while Billy, Jake, and I leaned against the port anchor block, waiting to begin hauling in the five-inch-thick sea lines that trailed down from the gypsy heads to the docks below. Billy began to complain. Jake reacted by breaking into one of his comic monologues and cracking Billy up. Then the word came in from the bridge over the Chief's radio, causing Billy to immediately affect an air of gravity. The Bosun mounted his short, fat frame before the winch controls and Jake took position nearby, working the lines on the winch roller. Such is the prerogative of old-timers. Billy and I grabbed the lead line and stood by. Below, on the dock, one of the longshoremen cast off the first line, and the Bosun threw on the winch. I followed Billy's motions, dragging the line across the deck and folding it into neat lines along the starboard rail. The sea-soaked and brine-encrusted line grew heavier and heavier as we got to the end that lay in the water by the pier. As the eye of the line was pulled up, Jake yelled at me to help Billy, who was dragging the last twenty feet across the deck by himself. "Always back a man up!&#x201d; This was my first on-hand lesson in the empathy among seamen. I grabbed the tail end and helped Billy stow it with the rest of the line.<br><br> By the fourth line my arms were dead. The winch only pulled the lines onto the deck; we had to stow them away. But gradually a rhythm set in. Jake and the Bosun set the pace, Billy and I executed it. The Chief leaned against the bulkhead and watched. The Bosun was uncharacteristically quiet around the Chief, and the other two wordlessly obeyed his commands. On the other hand, the Chief was continually glancing up at the bridge, where he knew the Captain stood watching. How the body politic functioned for the rest of the crew was as yet unknown to me. I had but one concern: to shut up and watch what the others did and try to learn it all as quickly as possible. It wasn&#x2019;t exactly the First Law of the Jungle, but the stakes were just as high.<br><br> The stern was the first part of the ship to be free of the dock, much to the chagrin of the 4-8 watch, which always had to work the bow. The stern not only has fewer lines than the bow, but it is also worked by both the 8-12 and the 12-4 watches. Just deserts, as it turned out: The 4-8watch gets three more hours of overtime than the other two.<br><br> The port spring line was the last to go. The Chief, clutching his radio, stared at the dockworkers below. They weren't going to sea. As we let go, they'd leave for home; that was the unspoken thought in everybody&#x2019;s mind.<br><br> The Bosun had been primarily concerned throughout the night only with the job at hand: Get the crew working, and don't get into a beef with the Chief. Billy and Jake just did the work, trying not to think about leaving. This was going to be a long voyage. The Chief's radio crackled: Let go the port spring line. For the last time the dockhand pulled the eye off the gypsy head and let it drop into the water. The Chief signaled the Bosun to start up the winch, and immediately our ears were pierced with the maddening whine of the outdated machinery grinding against itself. By now, neither Billy nor Jake had to yell out instructions above the roar-I responded automatically. The Bosun stared through his thick-lensed glasses at some undefined point beyond the bow. The Chief fidgeted with his radio and, with one eye on the bridge, surveyed our progress with a critical glare. Jake continued working the line on the winch, keeping up a truly magnificent semblance of hard work. Billy and I dragged the line. After a good five minutes the eye of the line finally slopped through the cholk, and the Bosun shut off the winch. It was now 2:30 a.m. The purring tugboats that eased us away from the docks would do all the work from here on out. With overtime money stashed safely away in our thoughts, we walked back to the house to catch an hour's sleep before we had to go on watch at 4:00a.m. We had missed setting sail on Friday the thirteenth by two and a half hours. No one said anything on the walk back. Everyone was tired. Tired and committed.<br><br> By the time we were in the house and had climbed the two flights to B deck, where the crew cabins lay, the ship was sailing under her own power. The dark banks of the New Jersey shore slipped by with increasing rapidity. On deck one could hear the huge engine room, buried stories beneath the main deck, begin to hum. The entire ship started to vibrate with the awesome gyrations of the massive diesel engines that turned the two-story-high screw. While you sat in your cabin, lights off and a watch pending, the hugeness of the ship could swallow you whole.<br> Chapter 2<br><br> It was simply a question of escape. Life at the university had become so unbearably entrenched that the only thing that mattered was getting as far away as possible. Something motivated me toward the Seafarers International Union to get my Z-card and a job out at sea.<br><br> Despite the sick feeling in my gut, that twinge every hitchhiker knows between the time he decides to hit the road and is actually liberated by a series of rides, I felt optimistic and recklessly carefree.<br><br> Oddly enough, it was my parents who had helped me join the Merchants. As both a politician and former longshoreman, my father had number of connections in the Seafarers International Union. Connections like that had helped a couple of my friends get jobs on freighters. This dream of a trip to any number of exotic lands, especially via so romantic and potentially lucrative a mode as the Merchant Marine, helped me to survive the last few manic days of the semester. It was in wonderfully ignorant bliss that I first became aware of the seaman's world.<br><br> At the union hall my contact, George, smiled when he arrived, shaking my hand and dropping a few pleasantries. He knew I didn&#x2019;t belong in the SIU-any one of the cigarette-smoking idlers outside watching the call board could tell you that. But inside the organization, business is business. The union officials never talk outright; they speak with their whole bodies, letting out a few exclamations here and there to make their point. It&#x2019;s a nonverbal dialect that allows for discreet understandings between parties and prevents unwanted ears from listening in.<br><br> In this way George straightened me out on the logistics that go with obtaining Seaman's Papers. The first order of business was going to the Coast Guard station at Battery Park and presenting them with his letter assuring me work on a ship.<br><br> The Coast Guard station was classic Art Deco, sightly and genteel, a contrast with the attitudes of those inside waiting to get their Seaman&#x2019;s Papers. The half dozen or so drifters who sat in the waiting room sucking on their cigarettes were much like their counterparts in the union hall.<br><br> Many were ex-navy men, old vets who had yet to settle down following their discharge, or who couldn't adjust to civilian life. I sat among them and smoked the better part of a pack myself. Periodically a gaunt kid in his twenties would call one of us behind the counter for the paperwork. The afternoon passed slowly.<br><br> At last it was my turn. The kid gave me a stack of forms to fill in, and I gave him my Social Security card. Then a large black woman fingerprinted me and told me to raise my right hand and repeat after her. The next thing I knew I had been sworn into the Coast Guard as a Merchant Marine.<br><br> With papers in hand, sea bag packed, and a valid passport, I returned to the union hall. George was no longer involved in the process of shipping me out; Abe, the bureaucrat at the desk, had been left with instructions that I was to be "taken care of." He took me into the main office and sat me before a desk while he left to arrange my job. I looked around, amazed. There in the office was the most disparate collection of journeymen I'd seen on three continents. A Rastafarian hustling his way into a flyout job in Costa Rica. A lithe secretary scolding a 330-pound bosun for improper registration procedure. Labor officials laughing with swarthy gentlemen in dark suits.<br><br> Abe returned with my job ticket.<br><br> "Ordinary Seaman on the Rose City. Leaves from Camden, New Jersey, early tomorrow for forty-five days in the Mediterranean."<br><br> I inspected the job ticket and felt a thrill of butterflies run up my spine.<br><br> Abe gave me a hard look. "You're John Moynihan. So far as anybody's concerned, your father is a bartender on the West Side."<br><br> I smiled. "He was, you know."<br><br> "I know. Good luck." We shook hands and I walked out accompanied by the furtive side-glances of those in the room.<br><br> That night I made my way to the Texaco refinery at Eagle Point in Camden. I got there at one a.m. and walked out to the empty pier where the ship was supposed to be. Somehow I'd imagined she'd be there already, friendly crewmen ready to greet me with a warm bunk and a cup of coffee. Instead there was only the hiss of the massive refinery, and the cold. Around three a.m. a security guard found me huddled over a hot-air vent for warmth and told me I could crash in the office. The office was locked, but the hall floor was warmer than the wet ground outside.<br><br> The dawn came and went, leaving the refinery looking like a madman's Erector Set creation in the harsh New Jersey sun. I sat on a bench outside the office, smoking my last pack of cigarettes between catnaps. Eventually a few taxis deposited other seamen at the gate. They had nothing to say, either to me or to one another. They only wanted to get on the ship before they changed their minds.<br><br> Then an old '67 Plymouth station wagon pulled up with eight noisy celebrants inside. They spilled out onto the pavement, took one look around, and, seeing that the ship wasn't there, jumped back into the car to the battle cry "To a bar! To a bar!"<br><br> When the dust settled, the other stranded seamen and I went back to the business of killing time. Before long two vans pulled up, followed by a caravan of cars. I nervously gravitated to where they set up shop, and soon found myself drinking dollar beers with a couple of the boys.<br><br> The topic of conversation was why the ship was so late. This was soon learned, with the flash of police lights along the river. A huge Wagoneer roared across the grass and pulled up in front of the vans. One of the two passengers yelled to a buddy of his by the beer cooler that the cook had gotten into a knife fight with the steward and the cops weren't going to release the ship for another couple of hours.<br><br> People were generally surprised to hear about the delay, but not the fight. One fellow leaned over to me and said he'd been on a ship in South America. "Pirates climbed up the anchor chain and stabbed the man on watch thirty-seven times in the back." He chuckled. "The poor sucker didn&#x2019;t die." I drained my beer and reached for another.<br><br> The ship did arrive that morning, though. She glided up the river, one huge, magnificent envelope of steel. Moving at a nearly imperceptible pace, the huge bulk cautioned into the dock. I could make out on the bow the distant figures of men scrambling madly, desperate to finish their final chore and get the hell off the ship they had been stuck on for the past four months. As I stood amid the vast wasteland of the Texaco refinery, the extent of the undertaking to which I was now committed was lost on me.<br><br> Up the long pier we walked. And with every step the ship grew in size. As we stood gathered next to her, waiting for the gangway to be lowered, the ship became disproportionately large, stretching the laws of physics to impossible limits. Then, looking around, I noticed a silent, angry fellow staring back at the shore. I thought he was just one of the boys, but something about him was different. Then he turned and began to question me in quiet, suspicious tones.<br><br> "What's your job? Where'd you get it? What time'd it go up on the board?"<br><br> I had no idea what he was talking about, or what the story was. I did know that somehow I was in trouble; the ordinary's job Abe got me in the New York City hall was meant for someone else.<br><br> I tried to bluff, acting nonchalant, as if I'd gotten the job by conventional means (even though at the time I hadn't a clue how a regular seaman got a job). He knew better. He was Billy Mahoney.<br> &nbsp;<br></p><h2>Exposed: Voyeurism, Surveillance, and the Camera Since 1870</h2><p><p><b>A shocking new exploration of the photographer as voyeur</b><br><br> Since the rise of the photographic medium in the late 19th century, people have been fascinated by the camera&#x2019;s ability to record striking moments both public and private.

There's no hibernating for this little bear: he's all eyes, ears, nose, and paws as he explores the delights of Christmas, and his emotions are as pure and unconstrained as any toddler's. Carlstrom captures it all perfectly, always maintaining a child-centered focus. Jesse finds Christmas in watching and helping his family decorate the tree, baking cookies with his mother and grandmothers, and hearing the sweet sounds of Christmas music. He feels Christmas in the warmth of his family's love. Degen's artwork is full of child appeal, whether he's picturing energetic Jesse skating, running, or flinging sprinkles in the air, or more quiet scenes of Jesse embraced by his parents. A winner. <i>Shelley Townsend-Hudson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

By the author of An Awfully Big Adventure. Reprint.</p><p>Beryl Bainbridge wrote seventeen novels, two travel books and five plays for stage and television, she was shortlisted for the Booker Prize five times, and won literary awards including the Whitbread Prize and the Author of the Year Award at the British Book Awards. She died in July 2010.Beryl Bainbridge's historical fiction should be required reading. Her complex portraits of people and events allow us to experience the possibilities of the past. In this novel, we view Robert Scott's 1912 Antarctic expedition through her incomparable lens. For her facts, she draws upon actual letters, journal accounts, and the memoirs of Apsley Cherry-Garrard, one of the survivors. Gordon Griffin's performance is masterful. His characterizations imply confusion in the seemingly self-assured and bravery in unlikely heroes. These explorers harbor petty jealousies yet offer the potential for courageous acts. Griffin presents them with little sentimentality, boisterous enthusiasm,and the distinct sense of children boasting. Bainbridge's mono-logues expose ingrained prejudices and class distinctions, casting light on the shadows found even in good men's souls.

Mann was educated under the discipline of North German schoolmasters before working for an insurance office aged nineteen. During this time he secretly wrote his first tale, Fallen, and shortly afterwards he left the insurance office to study art and literature at the University of Munich. After a year in Rome he devoted himself exclusively to writing. He was only twenty-five when Buddenbrooks, his first major novel, was published. Before it was banned and burned by Hitler, it had sold over a million copies in Germany alone. His second great novel, The Magic Mountain, was published in 1924 and the first volume of his tetralogy Joseph and his Brothers in 1933. In 1929 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. In 1933 Thomas Mann left Germany to live in Switzerland. Then, after several previous visits, in 1938 he settled in the United States where he wrote Doctor Faustus and The Holy Sinner. Among the honours he recieved in the USA was his appointment as a Fellow of the Library of Congress. He revisited his native country in 1949 and returned to Switzerland in 1952, where The Black Swan and Confessions of Felix Krull were written and where he died in 1955.</p><h2>Zen-Yoga: A Creative Psychotheraphy To Self-Integration</h2><p>This fascinating and profound book of ancient, Eastern, esoteric wisdom is backed by the latest discoveries and experiments of modern science, treats of the health of the soul by showing the relationship between soul and brain.

An investigation into the occult, the paranormal and the supernatural</h2><p>Book by Wilson, Colin</p><p></p><h2>The Enchantment</h2><p>Emmaline Hatter was a beautiful, brilliant, and rich Wall Street financier in the nineteenth century until the crash of 1893 wiped her out completely. Desperate to recoup her losses, she joins Dr. Larence Digby in his search for the legendary lost city of Cibola, rumored to be rich in gold. Emmaline was used to getting her own way, but Larence was not about to give up control of his expedition to a woman.

This second novel from Kristin Hannah proved to us she was definitely someone to watch, so we grabbed the opportunity to really promot and build her. I particularly liked this book because of its unusual hero. Lisa Congelosi, Sales RepEmmaline Amanda Hatter (the "Mad Hatter of Wall Street") and Dr. sp ok/pk Larence Digby are damaged goods. Both were orphaned young; the former was thrown on her own devices, which she parlayed into a vast fortune on Wall Street, while the latter, tormented by a crippled ankle and memories of an unsympathetic grandmother, became a fanciful professor at Columbia University. In 1893, the two meet in New York City when Emmaline funds Larence's pk expedition to the lost Aztec city of Cibola. They eventually become intimate when Emmaline is wiped out by the Wall Street crash and follows Larence to New Mexico in an attempt to get her money back or at the very least to insure her percentage of the expedition's spoils. Hannah ( A Handful of Heaven ) offers witty banter in the first half of the book; later, however, she resorts to broadcasting revelations that would be better left implied. As they draw closer to the magical Cibola, with its equally magical tubers and guardians, Larence and Emmaline learn that it's " okay to be afraid ,"stet itals to " laugh ," to be " together ," to trust, love, etc. If you wanted to know what would happen if Carlos Castaneda and Melody Beattie collaborated on a romance, here's your chance. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ten Days to Destiny: The Secret Story of the Hess Peace Initiative and British Efforts to Strike a Deal With Hitler</h2><p>Examines the mysterious mission of Rudolf Hess</p><p>A highly speculative historical argument from Costello (Virtue Under Fire, 1986, etc.): that the flight of Hitler's aide Rudolf Hess to Britain in May 1941 was not the isolated act of a madman, but the result of a year of secret maneuvering between the Nazi regime and appeasement-minded members of Churchill's cabinet. In the wake of the fall of France in May 1940, Costello argues, Britain's situation appeared so bleak that certain members of the coalition War Cabinet--conspicuously, Halifax, the foreign secretary--favored (and initiated) efforts to reach an accommodation with Hitler that would not threaten British independence. Churchill was engaged in a battle with these politicians as bitter in its way as the war with Germany, Costello maintains. He says (and many historians agree) that Hitler actually favored such a negotiated peace in order to give himself a free hand in the East. Costello argues (again, unexceptionably) that many members of the British political establishment and aristocracy sympathized with Hitler's fascist and anti-Semitic philosophy. However, Costello fails to make the connection convincingly between these well-documented facts and his central thesis--that Hess made his 1941 flight bearing an authoritative offer of peace from Hitler, and that the Hess flight was actually a last-minute attempt to reach a negotiated peace with Britain on the eve of Hitler's crusade against Bolshevism. Costello's evidence for this is slender and amounts to a highly conjectural circumstantial case. Provocative but unconvincing. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>On May 10, 1941, in one of WW II's most bizarre episodes, Rudolph Hess, the deputy fuhrer of Germany, parachuted onto Scottish soil. Costello ( I Was There ) uses recently declassified material to answer 50 years of speculation about the true purpose of Hess's mission. And his book offers some astonishing revelations. Among them: prominent members of Britain's ruling establishment (led by foreign secretary Lord Halifax) tried to negotiate a compromise peace with Hitler at the time of the fall of France in 1940; prime minister Churchill had to bluff and bully his war cabinet into rejecting Hitler's tempting peace overtures; the fuhrer's Halt Order of May 23, 1940, was a stratagem to persuade the British government to accept a deal. As to the Hess mission, the record now shows that the deputy fuhrer brought not only an authoritative peace proposal but an invitation from Hitler to support Germany's imminent crusade against the Soviet Union. Costello's riveting account leaves little doubt that, but for Churchill, WW II would have ended in June 1940, setting global history on a different and more sinister course. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Perils of Peace: America&#39;s Struggle for Survival After Yorktown</h2><p><p>On October 19, 1781, Great Britain's best army surrendered to General George Washington at Yorktown. But the future of the 13 former colonies was far from clear. A 13,000-man British army still occupied New York City, and another 13,000 regulars and armed loyalists were scattered from Canada to Savannah, Georgia.

Roszak died in July 2011.<br>This latest effort by the author of the seminal The Making of the Counterculture is a quirky, sexy, sprawling novel that comprises, among other things, a magical mystery tour of the history of cinema, an acid satire on Hollywood and what passes for today's cultural avant-garde, a metaphysical puzzle, an exploration of the psychological impact of films and a parable about the modern spiritual wasteland. UCLA film scholar and critic Jonathan Gates becomes obsessed with legendary German expressionist filmmaker Max Castle, who went to Hollywood in the mid-1920s and whose vampire and ghoul B-movies are viewed by cult fans as deeply troubling evocations of evil. On the trail of Castle's dark past, Gates and his ex-girlfriend, tough-minded film critic Clare Swann, encounter medieval gnostic heresies, secret societies, a teenage genius albino movie producer and an aged Dutch ex-vamp who practices tantric-like sex. Crammed with film lore that will regale cinema buffs, the narrative segues from its realistic beginning into a bizarre, apocalyptic fantasy that eventually spins off the reel, illuminating in the end only a very private, muddled vision. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cat Among the Pigeons ( A Hercule Poirot Mystery)</h2><p>Paperback mystery detective novel by the queen of British mystery, Agatha Christie. &#34;A Hercule Poirot Murder Mystery.&#34; Fiction.

Soon after Mother India&#x2019;s emergence in the late nineteenth century, artists, both famous and amateur, began to picture her in various media, incorporating the map of India into her visual persona. The images they produced enabled patriotic men and women in a heterogeneous population to collectively visualize India, affectively identify with it, and even become willing to surrender their lives for it. Filled with illustrations, including 100 in color, <i>The Goddess and the Nation</i> draws on visual studies, gender studies, and the history of cartography to offer a rigorous analysis of Mother India&#x2019;s appearance in painting, print, poster art, and pictures from the late nineteenth century to the present.<p></p><p>By exploring the mutual entanglement of the scientifically mapped image of India and a (Hindu) mother/goddess, Sumathi Ramaswamy reveals Mother India as a figure who relies on the British colonial mapped image of her dominion to distinguish her from the other goddesses of India, and to guarantee her novel status as embodiment, sign, and symbol of national territory. Providing an exemplary critique of ideologies of gender and the science of cartography, Ramaswamy demonstrates that images do not merely reflect history; they actively make it. In <i>The Goddess and the Nation</i>, she teaches us about pictorial ways of learning the form of the nation, of how to live with it&#x2014;and ultimately to die for it.</p></p><p>&#34;Filled with important and arresting observations, &#34;The Goddess and the Nation &#34;is a magnificent example of the possibilities of visual history. Guaranteed to have a substantial impact in South Asian cultural history, it also ought to be seen as a milestone for all historiography. Sumathi Ramaswamy situates a massively informed cultural history of India from the late nineteenth century onward in relation to broader literatures and debates on the history of cartography, iconographies of nationhood and motherhood, and a feminist dynamics of gendered identifications.&#34;--Christopher Pinney, author of &#34;&#34;Photos of the Gods&#34;: The Printed Image and Political Struggle in India&#34;<p>Sumathi Ramaswamy is Professor of History at Duke University.

She is an award-winning crime novelist, celebrated for the bestselling Brunetti series. Donna has lived in Venice for thirty years and previously lived in Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Iran and China, where she worked as a teacher. Donna&#39;s books have been translated into 35 languages and have been published around the world. Her previous novels featuring Commissario Brunetti have all been highly acclaimed; including Friends in High Places, which won the CWA Macallan Silver Dagger for Fiction, Fatal Remedies, Doctored Evidence, A Sea of Troubles and Beastly Things.*Starred Review* Leons twentieth novel starring Venetian police commissario Guido Brunetti is one of her best. But why? Not because she breaks new ground, either in terms of the characters or the story. This tale of the murder of a retired teacher who was helping abused women escape their abusers offers a sensitive but never by-the-numbers exploration of a contemporary social problem, as do many of the other novels in the series, and it takes plenty of breaks between the crime-solving to portray fan favorite Brunetti the family man, interacting joyously with his wife and children. It also delivers a typically Leon-style ambiguous ending in which traditional justice is either less important than or even detrimental to Brunettis real concern: doing his best to set things right for the various troubled souls he encounters in the course of his investigation. So what makes the book stand out? Its simply this: Brunetti walks around Venice a lot in this novel, and when he walks, he muses. And when he muses, the reader listens almost hypnotically, transfixed by the somehow ennobling ordinariness of this remarkable mans humanity but also by the subtlety of his mind and his absolute refusal to succumb to the tyranny of bureaucrats and moralists. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Leons popularity among mystery fans has grown steadily, but over the last several years, she has become a must-read for all those who favor character-driven crime stories. She is especially popular in libraries and among librarian mystery readers. --Bill Ott</p><h2>J.M. Young Arts and Crafts Furniture: 181 Photographs</h2><p>Excruciatingly ugly, dowdy furniture.

This is the story of one such internee George L. Peet whose diaries and records preserve a stunningly vivid portrait of the triumph of the human spirit in those trying times. Interned first at Changi Gaol, then at Sime Road Camp, Peet paints a detailed and moving picture of the world behind walls. The internees mostly British and mostly the top tier of pre-war Singapore society find themselves in vastly reduced circumstances, dispossessed and humiliated. Fortunately, their Japanese wardens, while enforcing strict security, left the running of the camps to the internees. And so, drawing on their respective skills from their peace-time occupations, the internees soon organized themselves into an elaborate functioning microcosm of society. Those who had been doctors served as camp doctors. Those who had been in the Department of Agriculture grew vegetables. The engineers saw to water and sanitation. The chemists made yeast for bread. And experts from every conceivable field took turns to lecture at the unofficial, in-house Changi University. In the author s own words: a veritable war-time Swiss Family Robinson indeed. With a sympathetic eye, Peet reveals the strength as well as the ugliness of human nature. Food, comfort, survival, morale, and a longing to be reunited with his wife and children fortunately evacuated to Australia form the main part of the author s thoughts, as well as the backbone of this riveting record.</p><p></p><h2>Dirty Czech (Dirty Everyday Slang): Everyday Slang from &#34;What&#39;s Up?&#34; to &#34;F*%# Off!&#34;</h2><p><strong>GET D!RTY</strong> <br><br><p>Next time you're traveling or just chattin' in Czech with your friends, drop the textbook formality and bust out with expressions they never teach you in school, including: <br><strong><br>� Cool slang <br><br>� Funny insults <br><br>� Explicit sex terms <br><br>� Raw swear words <br></strong><br><br><em><strong>Dirty Czech</strong></em> teaches the casual expressions heard every day on the streets of the Czech Republic: <br><br>What's up? &#x2015; <em>Co je?</em> <br><br>I adore your small titties &#x2015; <em>Zboznuju tvoje kuzlatka.</em> <br><br>I gotta take a leak. &#x2015; <em>Musim se vymocit.</em> <br><br>Your team sucks ass! &#x2015; <em>Tvuj tym je na hovno!</em> <br><br>Drop Dead you freak! &#x2015; <em>Chcipni, ty zrudo!</em> <br><br>I'm faded. &#x2015; <em>Jsem namazenej.</em> <br><br>Are you as horny as I am? &#x2015; <em>Jsi taky tak nadrzenej</em><br></p></p><p>Rare BookMartin Blaha grew up in Prague where he earned his bachelor degree in tourism and hotel management at the College of Business Studies.

[It] is the last natural process left to us,&#x201d; writes internationally lauded obstetrician Dr. Tadashi Yoshimura. &#x201c;The fact that it has remained unchanged means that there is truth in it.&#x201d; The truth and power of birth is the subject of Dr. Yoshimura&#x2019;s first book published in the United States. Yoshimura describes babies born so directly into the arms of their mothers that they do not cry, and women so transformed with pride and passion in their ability that they are joyous and forever changed. Instead of a medical emergency, Yoshimura describes birth as a transcendent and natural process that cannot be perfected, and that, when performed through the innate power of women, reveals what he calls a &#x201c;mystic beauty.&#x201d; Full of delightful stories of birthing women and peaceful smiling infants, and helpful tips from his childbirth preparation program, <i>Joyous Childbirth Changes the World </i>is a must-read for all expectant parents and those who care for them. Yoshimura&#x2019;s clinic serves as a testament to the kind of compassionate birth culture that is possible if we prioritize the health and experience of women and babies.</p><p><b>DR. TADASHI YOSHIMURA</b> is a Japanese obstetrician and natural birth advocate. His maternity clinic in Okazaki, Japan, is known internationally for its incredibly positive birth outcomes including a 3.4% Cesarean rate, despite the clinic accepting many high-risk patients.<br><br>Called "the mother of authentic midwifery,"&nbsp;<b>INA MAY GASKIN</b>&nbsp;has practiced for nearly forty years at The Farm Midwifery Center, which is noted for its low rates of intervention, morbidity and mortality. She is the only midwife for whom an obstetric maneuver has been named (the Gaskin maneuver). Gaskin lives in Tennessee.<b>Foreword</b> <br> by Ina May Gaskin <br><br>A true scientist is one who, on observing behavior and phenomena that do not conform to the received wisdom of his profession, is open-minded and brave enough to adapt his thought and practice to the deeper reality that he has perceived. Pioneers of this kind may experience great joy and satisfaction at their discovery, believing that their clarity of understanding will be obvious to everyone else. But those who have tried differing with established medical theory and practice often learn that simple concepts that create joy and save lives can be very hard for their peers to accept. This can be a lonely road. The lives and careers of Ignaz Philip Semmelweis, Joseph Lister, and Grantly Dick-Read&#x2014;great scientists all&#x2014;illustrate what can happen to the person who goes in the direction that science and common sense beckon, even when that means disagreeing with medical orthodoxy. Each received a significant dose of ridicule from professional colleagues, and in the case of Semmelweis, from those who had positions higher in the medical&nbsp;hierarchy than he enjoyed. Lister was the only one who lived to see significant change come about during his lifetime as a result of his work.&nbsp; <br><br>Tadashi Yoshimura is such a pioneer in the field of modern obstetrics. He knows that both midwives and obstetricians must be part of the maternity care team and they must be highly skilled. At the same time, he recognizes that when women&#x2019;s lifestyles are as healthy as were their great-grandmothers&#x2019; regarding their nutrition and levels of every day activity, most women will be able to go through their pregnancies and births in such a way that the obstetrician&#x2019;s services will be unnecessary, because the midwife&#x2019;s direct care will be sufficient for these healthy women who thus carry no great fear about the process of labor and birth. What this means in a practical sense is that the obstetrician should be the part of the maternity care team who is always there to go into action when needed but also be willing to stand aside when he or she is not needed. This requires a great deal of dedication and restraint on the part of the obstetrician, and a great respect for nature and for women&#x2019;s capacities to give birth. <br><br>This difficult balance is one that Yoshimura&#x2019;s clinic has achieved over several decades of serving Japanese families. It requires a staff of midwives and obstetricians who have very high esteem and respect for each other and for nature. It is rare that a practicing obstetrician will reject the model of care that he or she has been taught to provide in favor of incorporating a model that accepts the necessity of a strong midwifery component. The long history of tension between the professions of obstetrics and midwifery makes this a difficult and isolating career choice for an obstetrician. <br><br>I have been privileged to visit Yoshimura&#x2019;s clinic on two occasions, and each time I was struck by the powerful example&nbsp;of the work being done there and the lesson it offers maternity care systems in crisis in various parts of the world, where too many cultures have become superstitious in their worship of high technology methods applied to pregnancy and birth.&nbsp; <br><br>One visit was on the occasion of an obstetricians&#x2019; meeting at the Yoshimura clinic. About fifteen obstetricians from various parts of Japan were in attendance, along with one US obstetrician whose own wife is a midwife who assists home births. During that three-day meeting, it became evident that Yoshimura&#x2019;s message is beginning to reach some of his younger colleagues, who are each noticing what happens to obstetrics and midwifery as cultural levels of fear of birth rise. <br><br>Dr. Yoshimura&#x2019;s courage and vision in fashioning a clinic to meet the needs of women during pregnancy and birth have been remarkable, to say the least. I am certain that he has not been the only obstetrician to see fear on a laboring woman&#x2019;s face, but what was different about him is that one such incident motivated him to question a model of birth care that replaced the encouragement provided by nurturing midwives with machines that anchored women into painful positions. That same incident caused him to begin moving away from the medical model of maternity care that he had been taught and towards a more traditional model in which the woman herself played a leading role, not a passive one, in the primal drama of giving birth. The way he replaced that model with one that cast the laboring mother in the central role of the birth drama involved closely working with midwives while he disciplined himself to be an unobtrusive presence in the corner, allowing the mother to labor without making her nervous with his presence. When he did pick up a piece of equipment, it was more often a camera to capture those moments just following the birth than a pair of forceps or a scalpel. <br><br>When I learned how closely the statistics of the midwives working with Yoshimura match those from the Farm Midwifery Center where I work with my partner midwives, I knew that at the core, Yoshimura and I had to be proceeding from the same philosophy. We are in awe of nature&#x2019;s design. We recognize that undisturbed birth affords us humans the chance to witness the last natural process available to us and that if we are able to prepare all of the necessary participants in the process correctly, it is only rarely that technological help will prove necessary. <br><br> How interesting that an English major and an obstetrician trained in the latest technological methods could arrive at the same conclusion, coming at it via different routes. I was lucky enough to witness the most beautiful and perfect physiological birth possible as my first opportunity to witness labor or birth, and that event showed me that the biological design of women is in no way inferior to that of the rhinoceros, the elephant, the shrew, or the squirrel. <br><br>So here, at last, is the story of how Tadashi Yoshimura reached a philosophy of birth that is in harmony with nature but accepts that modern technology, too, has an important place in optimal maternity care. I have heard him say that obstetricians need to be willing to lay down their lives for the sake of the women. That may sound foolishly idealistic to some, but in an era when so many obstetricians in a growing number of countries of the world are allowing their own fears of being sued to influence their decisions to carry out unnecessary procedures on women that may sometimes be harmful, I think it&#x2019;s time that we remember that the beneficiaries of maternity care should be women and their babies, not the institutions that organize and benefit in some way from maternity care.</p><h2>Bone Carving : A Skillbase of Techniques and Concepts</h2><p>Bone Craving is an old as civilisation itself.

Showing that there have been complex cultural aspects to the carving of bone since the earliest times. In Bone Carving, Stephen Myhre has drawn with great sensitivity, on techniques and styles of carving from a wide range of Pacific cultures, particulary Maori. The result is a superbly practical handbook for anyone embarking upon this rapidly growing craft.</p><p></p><h2>Behind the Mountains</h2><p>With the powerful simplicity that characterizes the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Laughing Boy, Oliver La Farge depicts the colorful and true accounts of the enchanting life of his wife Consuelo Baca and her family on a sprawling sheep ranch in the 1920&#39;s.

They have created maps detailing key events in warfare for a wide range of publications, including The Historical Atlas of World War II.</p>This is one of the better atlases of WWII. The book is large at 13 in. by 10 in. and the color maps are large and easy to read. The maps are laid out chronologically from before the war to after the war. There is a running dialog which follows the maps, explaining briefly the events of the war. There is a Table of Contents and a Map list which will greatly help you find the map you're after. There are good photos, some full page which will add to your experience. In addition to maps there are graphic illustrations that depict certain conditions or statistics before and during the war. There is a graphic on industrial production, mobilization numbers, casualties etc. Though the maps are good and have good eye appeal, I prefer greater terrain details. Having more cities, towns and villages would help greatly for example when you are reading other books and you're trying to follow on your atlas. There would be many times you couldn't because the details are missing. Because rivers are so important in battle and much discussion is made in books, the rivers in your atlas should be named also. There are only few named in this atlas. There are no woods or swamps depicted either but they played an important part in battle. The troop movements in this atlas are not as exacting as they should be. This atlas is good and should satisfy all but the most demanding. --By Dave Schranck<br><br>When I'm reading books about WW2, I use this atlas as a crucial companion resource. I'm currently reading two books for the first time, "American Caesar", William Manchester's classic of Douglas MacArthur in the Pacific theatre and "When Titans Clashed", David Glantz's account of how the Red Army stopped Hitler. Without this atlas, I wouldn't be able to fully comprehend or appreciate the true breadth and scope of these crucial events in the Pacific and Eastern Front. This oversize atlas, 13x10 in., has huge color maps that chronologically spotlight major battles and campaigns, while charting detailed troop movements,etc. A brief narrative presents an overview and describes the significance of each campaign and battle. There are a few photos, maybe one every other page, but it's the maps and graphics that are outstanding. I never fully appreciated MacArthurs strategy in the Philippines until I studied these maps. How could he possibly defend a coastline the size of the United States? By referencing the maps and narrative in the atlas, I could better visualize the strategy and timeline behind events surrounding Operation Barbarossa, Stalingrad, Leningrad and truly appreciate the enormity of causalities suffered on the Eastern Front and how crucial the Eastern Front was to allied success. For military purists, this atlas lacks some rivers, towns and terrain, but for the average person wishing to better comprehend events during WW2, this is a wonderful atlas --By R. Perry -<br><br>I have found this atlas to be a very useful reference in my readings. While there are a few 1/2 or 1/4 page size maps, the majority of them are full page and in a book of this size they show a good amount of detail of the opposing armies fronts, troop movements and so on. My readings on WWII cover all theaters, and not having more than a basic knowledge of world gepgraphy it was sometimes hard for me to visualize or understand some of these campaigns or battles - having no point of reference to the names of the towns, cities or locations involved. This atlas helps me understand in greater detail the vast scope of the battlegrounds and campaigns in the Pacific, CBI, China, et al - showing the offenses, counter-offensives and helping me grasp a bit of the startegies. I just finished reading David Glantz's excellent "When Titan Clashed" and this atlas proved itself as an invaluable reference tool. Glantz's book is very detailed and this atlas has very good coverage of the German thrust of Operation Barbarossa and the major battles around Leningrad, Kharkov, Kursk and Stalingrad. It was especially usefaul covering the 1943 Soviet Winter Offensive which stretched the width of Russia from the Baltic to the Black Seas. It had overview maps of the entire front plus maps detailing the individual fronts such as the Ukraine, the Caucasus' and northern Russia and around Leningrad and the Karelian Front. I have the hardcover edition and it was worth the few extra $$. It is a huge, heavy sturdy book and the pages are printed on heavy stock paper for durability. The maps are all full colored and the different army groups, armies, divisions and so on involved are labeled with clearly defined arrows showing their movements. It is laid out in chronological order. It begins with the European layout right after WWI and the first 20 or so pages are devoted to the politcal make-up and alliances, the Depression in Germany and the rise of facism and into the invasion of Poland. There are a couple of interesting chapters at the end detailing some statistics of the combatants, such as manpower and troops mobilized, casualties and industrial production. As good as this atlas is it does miss out in not including or naming some of the topograhic and geographic details that were critical to some of the battles and campaigns, particularly the cities and towns and the rivers that needed to be crossed, or sometimes were the goals and end points of some of the offenses. --By Kirk D. Skorzak</p><h2>Hannibal</h2><p>During the second century B.C., the North African city of Carthage was a powerful commercial center. One of its leading citizens was Hannibal. Carthagian excursions into Roman territory led to the Punic Wars and Hannibal was called into service. <p>Ernle Bradford examines the campaign during the Second Punic War when Hannibal set out to invade Italy with a small force of select troops, crossing the Alps with a full baggage train intending to take Rome. For 16 years the campaign continued and Bradford examines the tactics of the major battles and traces the reasons why Hannibal failed to conquer the Romans.</p></p><p>6 1.5-hour cassettesErnle Bradford was born in 1922 and died in 1986.

Employing insurgent guerrilla tactics that became commonplace in later centuries, Marion and his brigade inflicted enemy losses that were individually small but cumulatively a large drain on British resources and morale.<br><br>Although many will remember the stirring adventures of the "Swamp Fox" from the Walt Disney television series of the late 1950s and the fictionalized Marion character played by Mel Gibson in the 2000 film <i>The Patriot</i>, the real Francis Marion bore little resemblance to either of those caricatures. But his exploits were no less heroic as he succeeded, against all odds, in repeatedly foiling the highly trained, better-equipped forces arrayed against him.<br><br>In this action-packed biography we meet many colorful characters from the Revolution: Banastre Tarleton, the British cavalry officer who relentlessly pursued Marion over twenty-six miles of swamp, only to call off the chase and declare (per legend) that "the Devil himself could not catch this damned old fox," giving Marion his famous nickname; Thomas Sumter, the bold but rash patriot militia leader whom Marion detested; Lord Cornwallis, the imperious British commander who ordered the hanging of rebels and the destruction of their plantations; "Light-Horse Harry" Lee, the urbane young Continental cavalryman who helped Marion topple critical British outposts in South Carolina; but most of all Francis Marion himself, "the Washington of the South," a man of ruthless determination yet humane character, motivated by what his peers called "the purest patriotism."<br><br>In <i>The Swamp Fox</i>, the first major biography of Marion in more than forty years, John Oller compiles striking evidence and brings together much recent learning to provide a fresh look both at Marion, the man, and how he helped save the American Revolution.<br></p><p><b>John Oller</b>, a lawyer and journalist, is the author of the critically acclaimed biographies of actress Jean Arthur and Kate Chase Sprague, Mary Todd Lincoln's great rival.

He is currently the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space and a research associate in the department of astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History. From 2006 to 2011, he hosted the educational science television show <i>NOVA ScienceNow</i> on PBS and has been a frequent guest on <i>The Daily Show</i>, <i> The Colbert Report</i>, <i> Real Time with Bill Maher</i>, and <i>Jeopardy</i>. In March 2014, he became host of the television series <i>Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey</i>, an update of Carl Sagan's <i>Cosmos: A Personal Voyage</i>. Tyson has written several nonfiction books, including <i>Death by Black Hole</i>, which was a <i>New York Times </i>bestseller.<br><br>Celebrity scientist Tyson's profound intellect is matched by his charm and wit. In this slim title, he attempts to explain some of the most complex astrophysics concepts in layman's terms. Readers should be prepared for a challenging yet edifying experience from the get-go: "In the beginning...all the space and all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence." Tyson riffs on topics such as gravity, the speed and makeup of light, the shape of space, and dark matter, maintaining as chatty a tone as possible as he tries to make these important principles comprehensible to the uninitiated. VERDICT Likely to resonate the most with those with a scientific bent, but Tyson's pop culture appeal expands the audience somewhat.&#x2014;Jamie Watson, Baltimore County Public Library</p><h2>More Fool Me: A Memoir</h2><p>Stephen Fry invites readers to take a glimpse at his life story in the unputdownable More Fool Me. &#39;Oh dear I am an arse. I expect there&#39;ll be what I believe is called an &#34;intervention&#34; soon. I keep picturing it. All my friends bearing down on me and me denying everything until my pockets are emptied. Oh the shame&#39; In his early thirties, Stephen Fry - writer, comedian, star of stage and screen - had, as they say, &#39;made it&#39;. Much loved in A Bit of Fry and Laurie, Blackadder and Jeeves and Wooster, author of a critically acclaimed and bestselling first novel, The Liar, with a glamorous and glittering cast of friends, he had more work than was perhaps good for him. What could possibly go wrong? Then, as the 80s drew to a close, he discovered a most enjoyable way to burn the candle at both ends, and took to excess like a duck to breadcrumbs. Writing and recording by day, and haunting a never ending series of celebrity parties, drinking dens, and poker games by night, in a ludicrous and impressive act of bravado, he fooled all those except the very closest to him, some of whom were most enjoyably engaged in the same dance. He was - to all intents and purposes - a high functioning addict. Blazing brightly and partying wildly as the 80s turned to the 90s, AIDS became an epidemic and politics turned really nasty, he was so busy, so distracted by the high life, that he could hardly see the inevitable, headlong tumble that must surely follow . . . Containing raw, electric extracts from his diaries of the time, More Fool Me is a brilliant, eloquent account by a man driven to create and to entertain - revealing a side to him he has long kept hidden.</p><p>Stephen Fry is an award-winning comedian, actor, presenter and director. He rose to fame alongside Hugh Laurie in A Bit of Fry and Laurie (which he co-wrote with Laurie) and Jeeves and Wooster, and was unforgettable as General Melchett in Blackadder. He hosted over 180 episodes of QI, and has narrated all seven of the Harry Potter novels for the audiobook recordings. He is the bestselling author of four novels - The Stars&#39; Tennis Balls, Making History, The Hippopotamus and The Liar - as well as three volumes of autobiography - Moab is My Washpot, The Fry Chronicles and More Fool Me.&#x201c;Fry is an astonishingly charming fellow: erudite, playful and capable of writing in a style so intimate that readers can picture themselves sitting next to him at a splendid dinner party as he rather one-sidedly entertains the entire table...Fry is a multi-hyphenate talent.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Slate</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The Fry Chronicles is so slickly charming it seems churlish to harrumph.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></strong></p><h2>Crows: Encounters with the Wise Guys of the Avian World</h2><p>Who knew that crows are second only to humans as toolmakers and tool users, that they have complex family lives not unlike our own, and that their vocalizations resemble human languages? This witty, charming book introduces readers to these endlessly fascinating creatures. Author Candace Savage explores their evolution and basic biology, diet and food-gathering practices, incredible tool-using capabilities, crow languages,&#x201d; tricky social interactions, and their impact on the human imagination as reflected in mythology, literature, and popular aphorisms. Based on extensive research, the book is a lively, loving tribute to these special feathered friends.</p><p>In this charming introduction to the genus Corvus, Savage consolidates scientific research with myths and legends, to attest to the cleverness of crows, ravens, rooks and jackdaws. Savage begins with reports of tool-use by crows in New Guinea; they not only use bits of twig to dig insects out of narrow holes, but they also shape the twigs to form hooks that grab insects and prevent them from escaping. As legends show, humans have been fascinated by crows for thousands of years, and the raven plays a prominent role in many aboriginal creation myths. Synthesizing science and storytelling, Savage shows that the ancient image of crow-as-trickster bears out among contemporary researchers, who have observed such crow behavior as misrepresentation and misdirection. In addition, some species of crow show evidence of language skills and even artistic sensibility (as in the case of a winged shell collector). They also exhibit cooperative child-rearing, as well as grieving behavior after losing a mate or chick. Though this illuminating book ends too quickly, readers wishing to follow up on the clever Corvus will be quite pleased with Savage's detailed footnotes and lengthy list of references. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As food, fertility symbol, genetic marvel, and subject of ancient myths, corn is one of the oldest food staples and a truly American food source. And because the author covers so much material, it's best to approach The Story of Corn bit by bit to avoid being overwhelmed. While it's fun to read about the history of popcorn (popcorn poppers dating back to A.D. 100 have been found in Peru), it's downright fascinating to read about what corn meant to native North and South Americans. Apparently corn was used in everything from funerals to birth rituals; corn images are embedded in the Hopi language. Fussell even tracked down a retired moonshiner to find out how corn was used to make corn whiskey and its more socially acceptable cousins, bourbon and Peruvian chicha . The author, descended from Nebraska farmers for whom corn was a mainstay, weaves her family's history into the larger saga. And along the way, she unfortunately consorts with some rather highfalutinok language ("The migration of my ancestors was across continents, up and away from the earth navel of fallen man.

But the volume is otherwise so absorbing and well written that she's easily forgiven. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Fussell (Food in Good Season, 1988, etc.) has steeped herself in corn lore and emerged with this encyclopedic entry on that sustaining American grain in myth, ritual, history, science and technology, breeding and cultivation, industry, processing, and cookery (not recipes, just a survey)--with a chapter on corn whiskey thrown in and an interweaving of personal root-claiming by way of a Nebraska grandfather. Fussell has clearly done a good deal of research and a lot of traveling--peering over a precipice at Machu Picchu, descending into a restored ceremonial kiva of the Anasazi people in New Mexico, visiting the sole surviving corn palace from the Midwest boosters' glory days of a century ago--but her prose fails to vivify the scenes she's visited, and, without any argument or added insights, her research reports have a secondhand, summarizing quality. Still, the labor and immersion are evident, and libraries should find uses for Fussell's odd compilation.

In "The Second Hut", a Rhodesian farmer is torn with anxiety and guilt about employing a poor Boer assistant with ni ' me children because of the hostility between Boer and native workers. One brings away a sense, of the sheer human impossibility of South Africa, as a place fit only for habitation by the imagination of exiles and of children. All else seems lost, betrayed and spoiled, except the glare of the sun, the dust, the boulders. An impressive collection.' - Gabriel Pearson, Daily Telegraph </p> <p>'Doris Lessing's sense of setting is so immediate, the touch and taste of her continent is so strong, that Africa seems to become the universe.' - Newsweek</p>Doris Lessing is one of the most important writers of the second half of the twentieth century. Her first novel, &#39;The Grass is Singing&#39; was published in 1950, and since then her international reputation has flourished. Among her other celebrated novels are &#39;The Golden Notebook&#39;, &#39;The Summer Before the Dark&#39;, and &#39;Memoirs of a Survivor&#39;. Her most recent works include &#39;Love, Again&#39; and two volumes of her autobiography, &#39;Under my Skin&#39;, and &#39;Walking in the Shade&#39;.</p><h2>Beatles: A Private View</h2><p>Bob&#39;s photos were amongst the best ever taken of the Beatles. Paul McCartney</p><p>The With The Beatles album cover was taken soon after I met them for the first time inBournemouth. Since the photograph was needed urgently, I had to improvise a studiosituation in the hotel. The dining room was the most suitable location. There was a broadsidelight from the windows and a deep maroon curtain that could be pulled behind themto create a dark background. They came down at midday wearing their black polo-neckedsweaters. It seemed natural to photograph them in black-and-white wearing their customarydark clothes. It gave unity to the image. There was no makeup, hairdresser or stylist--justmyself, The Beatles and a camera--a Pentax SLR with a 180mm telephoto lens. The lensaperture was set at F22 to ensure depth of focus between Ringo in the foreground and Paul at the back. The telephoto lensalso compressed them into a tight group shot with all the heads more or less the same size. They had to fit into the squareformat of the cover, so rather than have them all in a line, I put Ringo in the bottom right corner. He was the last to jointhe group, he was the shortest and he was the drummer! Even so, he still had to bend his knees to get to the right level--and look natural! <p>Some people have thought the image was a montage, but it was a single shot. The printing of the sleeve turned out much darker than expected. A lot of the textured quality in the reproduction print was lost. In fact the English version looked like four white faces in a coal cellar. Fortunately, the American version, with the title changed to Meet The Beatles, was the same black-and-white photograph with a blue tone, showing more detail in the shadow area. </p><p>This cover shot was an extension of my black-and-white jazz photography and the idea for the composition came from a photograph taken earlier the same year of three graphic designers (see previous page). The picture had a mood and directness that was the antithesis of the way groups usually appeared on album covers at that time. George Martin deserves credit for supporting this approach since colour was the norm for pop albums. Although George ran the subsidiary Parlophone label, the cover had to be approved by the management at EMI. </p><p>My original idea was to feature the picture of The Beatles across the whole album without logos or titles. By then, The Beatles were famous and their faces well known. This would have been a truly original breakthrough. But the proposal was too radical for EMI, and at the time neither Brian nor The Beatles had authority over those decisions. That changed a few years later with Rubber Soul. </p><p>I was originally offered the equivalent of $50 for the cover, which was the standard fee, but a far cry from what photographers make for covers today. However, Brian did support me in persuading EMI to pay double their normal fee--$100. A bargain considering the number of albums sold worldwide and the description in the New York Times Book Review that it was the "quintessential rock album cover."</p></p><h2>Exo (a novel)</h2><p>It&#39;s been a century of peace since Earth became a colony of an alien race with far reaches into the galaxy.

Her new teaching gig on a fancy cruise line nabs her a free vacation--and access to a 24-hour buffet! But sooner than you can say "bon voyage," Jaine's all-expenses-paid trip to the Mexican Riviera seems destined to be a wreck. . .<br><br>Things are already off to a rocky start when Jaine discovers a stowaway amidst her luggage--her persnickety cat Prozac. Jaine's sinking sensation grows stronger at dinner, where she meets chatty Emily Pritchard, a wealthy seventy-year-old who's traveling with her two nephews. Jaine can't help noticing the tension among them, especially when the cruise's charming--and sleazy--British dancer, Graham, whisks Emily out onto the dance floor. <br><br>Soon Emily is accepting Graham's invitations to every social event on the ship. Two nights later the bubbly couple announces their engagement, but the news is quickly overshadowed the next morning by the discovery of Graham's body with an ice pick protruding from his chest. . .<br><br>Between hiding a furry fugitive, flirting with Emily's nephew Robbie, and baiting the hook for a clever murderer, Jaine is about to dive into her most dangerous case yet. . .</p><p>In Levine's highly amusing if rather breathless eighth Jaine Austen mystery (after 2008's <i>Killing Bridezilla</i>), freelance writer Jaine gets a gig conducting a writing course on a seven-day cruise from L.A. to Mexico. The trouble begins when Jaine realizes her sneaky cat, Prozac, has stowed away in her luggage. Jaine bargains with Samoa, her eccentric steward, to keep Prozac's presence a secret by promising to read and edit <i>Do Not Distub</i> (sic), his 900-page thriller about a swashbuckling steward. Levine's lively wit keeps the familiar <i>Love Boat</i>&#x2013;esque shenanigans afloat as Emily Pritchard, an elderly wealthy singleton, falls for Graham Palmer III, a botoxed gentleman escort and gold digger, who's engaged to Cookie Esposito, the ship's lounge singer. Emily's engagement to Graham throws her family in a tizzy, ditto the spurned Cookie, who's later suspected of the gigolo's ice-pick murder. In the delicious denouement, Samoa's bulky manuscript serves a useful nonliterary purpose. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The cards in his wallet identify him as Samson Greene, a Columbia University English professor last seen leaving campus eight days ago. Thirty-six years old, with a wife, Anna, and a dog, Frank. But Samson doesn&#x2019;t even recognize his own name, and by the time Anna has made her away across the country to pick him up, doctors have discovered a cherry-sized tumor in his brain; its removal eradicates the last twenty-four years of Samson&#x2019;s memories.<br><br>Samson and Anna return to New York together, where Samson struggles to connect with the woman he knows he is supposed to love, with his career, with his home, with his &#x201c;life.&#x201d; He remembers his mother, his childhood in California, the basic shape and processes of the world, but everything else remains blank. In the meantime, Anna sees the same husband she has always seen, but every day has to steel herself against the notion that the man she loves is the Samson who remembers the last quarter century, the Samson who has been shaped by the history of their lives together.<br><br>Into these daily lives fraught with a peculiarly intimate tension comes a charismatic scientist who invites Samson to take part in a groundbreaking, experimental project involving the transfer of memories from one mind to another&#x2013;all it requires is a trip back to the Nevada desert. It doesn&#x2019;t take much to lure Samson away from his profound loneliness in the City&#x2013;where he is stuck between missing the past life that surrounds him and yearning to enjoy the fresh start he&#x2019;s been given&#x2013;though Anna is never far from his thoughts as he embarks on the adventure that could mean the end of the old Samson Greene.<br><br>In Samson, Nicole Krauss creates an ordinary man who his facing a searingly new world with gritty poignancy and purely instinctual empathy. Reminiscent of early DeLillo, but with the emotional sensitivity of a budding Cheever, Krauss&#x2019;s sharp, intelligent storytelling effortlessly peels away the layers of quotidian circumstances to reveal the subtle joys and woes of simple survival.</p><p>Nicole Krauss's elegant, haunting debut, <i>Man Walks into a Room</i>, is a what-if novel. What if, asks Krauss, a man woke up one day and he'd forgotten everything he knows? Samson Greene is found lost in the desert near Las Vegas, memory-less thanks to a tumor "applying its arbitrary, pernicious pressure to his brain." Once the tumor is removed, he can remember his childhood up until his 12th year, but then all is blank. He returns to New York, to his wife Anna, to his life as a Columbia University English professor, but none of these things makes sense to him anymore: "Samson could dredge up no feeling for his own life but that of vague admiration." When he receives a call from a mysterious scientist inviting him back to the desert for a sinister-sounding memory experiment, Samson heads West with a kind of despondent fatalism. Krauss's novel moves gracefully from exploration of a lost soul to science fiction to a meditation on memory. If the book unravels a bit at the end, it's only because Krauss is trying to do too much--certainly no literary sin. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>&#x201c;<i>Man Walks into a Room</i>; Nicole Krauss, with this remarkably felt, sharp-witted debut novel, strides into the forecourt of American letters.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Susan Sontag<br><br>&#x201c;Poignant and distinctive, forceful and prophetic, Nicole Krauss&#x2019;s sentences are blazed into these pages like a revelation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Ken Kalfus<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Man Walks into a Room </i>is that rare thing: an evocative, finely written first novel that is a true work of fiction.

Andrew Williams focuses on the first four years of this bitter conflict, during which time German submarines sank an astounding twelve million tons of Allied shipping. The story reaches its climax in May 1943, when the introduction of new weapons and tactics turned the tide of the battle and enabled the Allies to contain and finally defeat the dreaded German &#34;wolf packs.&#34; Interweaving scores of first-person accounts from survivors of both sides, The Battle of the Atlantic follows the exploits of the charismatic U-boat commanders who led their crews to the hunt-and often to their deaths. It goes aboard the merchantmen and escort ships that were both victim and nemesis to the &#34;gray wolves&#34; of the sea. And it enters the war rooms of the German, British, and American navies, where code-breakers and strategists angled for any advantage in a race that spelled doom to its loser. This dramatic chronicle sheds new light on one of the most dangerous conflicts of the Second World War.</p><p><b>Andrew Williams</b> is a writer and producer for the BBC. He has produced such internationally acclaimed programs as "A Journey Home," a documentary on the famine in Somalia, as well as the Emmy-nominated "War Crime: Five Days in Hell," an investigation into war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, and "Provos: The IRA and Sinn Fein." He lives in London.The Battle of the Atlantic (1939-1945) was one of the most crucial of World War II; tens of thousands of sailors were killed on each side, and German U-boats almost succeeded in choking off the supply lines on which Britain's survival depended. This hard-fought conflict gets an engrossing retelling in this companion to the History Channel series. Williams, producer of War Crime: Five Days in Hell for the BBC, covers every aspect of the cat-and-mouse game in which U-boats stalked merchant convoys across the ocean and were in turn hunted by Allied planes and destroyers. It's a harrowing tale, full of torpedo attacks, depth-chargings and drownings in the icy North Atlantic, and Williams draws on many first-hand accounts, both German and Allied, to bring it to life. He also pulls back to examine the strategic dimensions of the battle, exploring the development of German wolf-pack tactics, the initially bumbling Allied efforts to organize convoys and escorts, and the increasingly sophisticated anti-submarine warfare techniques that eventually drove the wolf packs from the North Atlantic. Williams is especially good at explaining the vital development of sonar, radar, detection and decryption technologies that enabled Allied escorts to locate, evade and destroy the stealthy U-boats with ever greater success. The conflict was both a nerve-wracking battle of wits and an epic of self-sacrifice, and Williams's thorough research and skillful storytelling does it full justice.

Colin Thubron intertwines myth, history and personal anecdote in a quest from which the characters and places, architecture and landscape all spring vividly to the reader's eye.</p><p>COLIN THUBRON is an acknowledged master of travel writing, and the winner of many prizes and awards. His first writing was about the Middle East -- Damascus, Lebanon and Cyprus. In 1982 he travelled into the Soviet Union in an ancient Morris Marina, pursued by the KGB, a journey he recorded in Among the Russians. From these early experiences developed his classic travel books: <b>Behind the Wall</b><i> </i>(winner of the Hawthornden Prize and the Thomas Cook Travel Award), <b>The Lost Heart of Asia, In Siberia</b><i> </i>(Prix Bouvier) and <b>Shadow of the Silk Road</b><i> </i>(all available in Vintage). In 2010 Colin Thubron became President the Royal Society of Literature.&#34;Thubron writes very well indeed...

Lewis's biting satire received a 1999 Grammy nomination for best spoken-word performance, and it's easy to see why--the story fits the format perfectly. It's relatively brief (the unabridged reading takes a mere four hours), and contains only one character--the demon Screwtape, who writes letters to his novice nephew Wormwood, instructing him on how to best tempt his "patient" (a wayward soul on earth) into the bosom of "our Lord below." <p> Obviously, the book wasn't written with former Monty Python John Cleese in mind, but it's hard to imagine a better Screwtape. Cleese's voice provides the perfect vehicle for Lewis's dry, razor-edged wit. His uncanny comic timing and ability to milk each phrase for maximum effect betray an infectious enthusiasm for the story. It's clear that he's having a great time reading, and it's impossible not to laugh along with him. This inspired pairing of two of the 20th century's greatest wits makes for a meditation on the dark side of spiritual guidance that's as relevant and funny today as it was in Lewis's war-torn England. (Running time: 4 hours, 3 cassettes) --<i>Andrew Neiland</i></p>His letters are signed, save one, "Your affectionate uncle", yet Uncle Screwtape's purposes in writing to his young nephew are hardly innocent. Penned in a brisk, businesslike style, old Screwtape offers the gullible Tempter Wormword fiendishly clever advice on his most pressing concern: the winning of young lives to the devil.<p>First published in 1941, The Screwtape Letters, a perennial best seller, has earned a place in the library of classics. The truths contained in C. S. Lewis's treatise on human nature are as old as the world, but his witty observations continue to confront and challenge believers and nonbelievers alike.</p><p>The outcome of Screwtape's correspondence is not known. But judging from his final signoff -- "Your increasingly and ravenously affectionate uncle" -- his appetite for evil has not lessened.</p></p><h2>Nowhere in Africa: An Autobiographical Novel</h2><p><i>Nowhere in Africa </i>is the extraordinary tale of a Jewish family who flees the Nazi regime in 1938 for a remote farm in Kenya. Abandoning their once-comfortable existence in Germany, Walter Redlich, his wife Jettel, and their five-year-old daughter, Regina, each deal with the harsh realities of their new life in different ways. Attorney Walter is resigned to working the farm as a caretaker; pampered Jettel resists adjustment at every turn; while the shy yet curious Regina immediately embraces the country&#x2014;learning the local language and customs, and finding a friend in Owuor, the farm's cook. As the war rages on the other side of the world, the family&#x2019;s relationships with their strange environment become increasingly complicated as Jettel grows more self-assured and Walter more haunted by the life they left behind. In 1946, with the war over, Regina's fondest dream comes true when her brother Max is born. Walter's decision, however, to return to his homeland to help rebuild a new Germany puts his family into turmoil again.<br><br>Visit the Web site for the film at www.nowhereinafrica.com</p><p><p>1995 hardcover German edition, <i>Nirgendwo in Afrika</i>, Langen M�ller Herbig </p><p>Terrace Books, a trade imprint of the University of Wisconsin Press </p><p><i>Nowhere in Africa</i> is the first English-language edition of the best-selling autobiographical novel that is the basis for the 2002 Academy Award winner for best foreign-language film.

In 1938 she and her parents fled to Kenya, as a result of the Nazi persecution of Jews. Her father, a lawyer and notary public, worked as a manager on a farm and earned just enough to finance his daughter's schooling. The family spent most of its time in Ol&#x2019; Joro Orok, situated directly at the Equator&#x2014;3,000 meters above sea level&#x2014;a very remote place, even for Africa. In 1944 Stefanie Zweig's father enlisted in the British Army, which also enabled him and his family to return to Germany in 1947. Upon their return, they were shocked to see so much destruction, hunger, and despair. Stefanie, who could not read or write German, had problems adjusting to this alien world. However, after graduating from high school she worked as a journalist for a Jewish newspaper. In 1963 she became the chief editor of the culture section of the Abendpost-Nachtausgabe in Frankfurt. She has been working as a freelance journalist and author since 1988.

Rey combine forces in this oversized picture book about the evolution of dinosaurs. From the conquest of land by dino ancestor <i>Acanthostega</i> during the Devonian Period, through the mass die-off of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous Period, Bakker and Rey take readers on a safari through time while paying subtle homage to the 1960 Giant Golden Book <i>Dinosaurs and Other Prehistoric Reptiles</i> that inspired them both as young dinophiles. With stops along the way to look at monster bugs, ferocious fin-backs, fluffy dinosaurs, sea monsters and the 12-year-old girl who discovered them, dinosaur orchestras, tickling tyrannosaurs, and much, much more, this is a journey readers will never forget. It's a perfect gift for young dinosaur lovers&#x2014;as well as adult fans of Dr. Bakker and Luis Rey!</p><p>DR. ROBERT T. BAKKER is one of the most respected vertebrate paleontologists in the world.

With the feathers--30 to 50 to every inch--the Indians fastened beads to the basket&#39;s border and hung pendants of polished abalone shell from the basket itself. Pomo women sometimes spent months or years making such gift baskets. Pomo baskets were not only gifts, Archambault says. Baskets were central to Pomo life. Featherless woven baskets of different sizes and shapes were made mostly by women for a variety of purposes: Pomo children were cradled in baskets; acorns--a major food staple--were harvested in great conical burden baskets, and wickerwork fish traps and quail traps--made by Pomo men--helped furnish other seasonal foods. In fact, food was stored, cooked and served in baskets, some watertight. In earth colors of black, tan and deep brown, the baskets were often covered or accented with tiny colored songbird feathers, clamshell disks (which once served the Pomo as money), glass beads, abalone pendants and stones. They brought in good money for Pomo women, who could earn between $30 and $60 per basket. It beat doing white people&#39;s laundry at $1 a day or picking stringbeans for $1.50; what&#39;s more, it could be done at home. Often, several generations of a family participated, mothers teaching their daughters and granddaughters.</p><p>At the time of its publication in 1908, Pomo Indian Basketry was the most complete and detailed study of a single Native American basketry tradition. This edition is supplemented with two early articles and the introduction identifies a community of talented Pomoan basket weavers who were the sources of Barrett&#39;s collections and information.<b>Sherrie Smith-Ferri</b> (Dry Creek Pomo/Bodega Miwok) is a curator at the Grace Hudson Museum in Ukiah, California.</p><h2>The White Lioness: A Mystery (Kurt Wallander Mysteries)</h2><p>In the second Kurt Wallander mystery by the award-winning author of Faceless Killers, Inspector Wallander investigates the execution of a Swedish housewife, which uncovers a plot to assassinate Nelson Mandela and leads him into a tangle with the South African secret service.</p><p>Third in the Kurt Wallander series. <br>The execution-style murder of a Swedish housewife looks like a simple case even though there is no obvious suspect.

From all of this Blood emerges as a complex, perhaps even a tortured figure.

At another table a young man with a ravaged face is drinking wine and reading Werner Heisenberg&#39;s Physics and Philosophy. They begin to talk. All through the night as they go from bar to bar the young man tells the story of the great love of his life, of how in the midst of their rapture the woman inexplicably disappeared, and of how he is now driving across Europe in a desperate attempt to find her. After they part in the pre-dawn light the old man returns to his rooms and finds himself beset by questions. Why can he not forget this young man Who was the woman he was with and why did she leave him These questions lead him back through his own life, from pre- and post-war Poland, to his membership of the Communist Party and his own life-altering love affair with a woman he met in Berlin and then ran away with to the sand dunes of the Baltic coast until she, too, left him without explanation. Through the years that followed he wandered the world trying to escape from the memory of her. Now, back in a small town in Poland, he begins to assemble stories both from his own past and that of the young man and the woman he loved and lost until he finds himself on an unexpected quest. Light traverses Europe and parts of America, the history of physics and political changes in Central Europe. It is about love and ruin, East and West, friendship and betrayal, the search for certainty and the consequent disillusionment.

Tolkien&#x2019;s <em>The Hobbit</em>, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, and <em>Silmarillion</em> have long been recognized as among the most popular fiction of the twentieth century, and most critical analysis of Tolkien has centered on these novels.&nbsp; Granted access by the Tolkien estate and the Bodleian Library in Oxford to Tolkien&#x2019;s unpublished writings, Verlyn Flieger uses them here to shed new light on his better known works, revealing a new dimension of his fictive vision and giving added depth of meaning to his writing.</p> <p>Tolkien&#x2019;s concern with time&#x2015;past and present, real and &#x201c;faerie&#x201d;&#x2015;captures the wonder and peril of travel into other worlds, other times, other modes of consciousness.&nbsp; Reading his work, we &#x201c;fall wide asleep&#x201d; into a dream more real than ordinary waking experience, and emerge with a new perception of the waking world.&nbsp; Flieger explores Tolkien&#x2019;s use of dream as time-travel in his unfinished stories <em>The Lost Road</em> and <em>The Notion Club Papers</em> as well as in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and his shorter fiction and poetry.</p> <p>Analyzing Tolkien&#x2019;s treatment of time and time-travel, Flieger shows that he was not just a mythmaker and writer of escapist fantasy but a man whose relationship to his own century was troubled and critical.&nbsp; He achieved in his fiction a double perspective of time that enabled him to see in the mirror of the past the clouded reflection of the present.</p></p><p><strong>Verlyn Flieger</strong> is professor emerita of English at the University of Maryland where she teaches courses on Tolkien, medieval and modern literature, and comparative mythology.

Visit her at MaryAliceMonroe.com and at Facebook.com/MaryAliceMonroe.The beach house sat perched on a dune overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. Small and yellow, it blended in with the waves of sweetgrass and sea oats and the delicate yellow prim-roses for which the cottage was named. For eighty-five years it had endured the fury of hurricanes, the rush of tidal surges, and the ravages of the salt-tinged air. It had withstood the test of time.<br><br>The beach house was a survivor.<br><br>As was she, Cara Rutledge thought, staring up at the house. She held a paintbrush in one hand and, shading her eyes from the gentle rays of the sun with the other, surveyed the fresh coat of gleaming white paint she&#x2019;d just finished applying to the front porch and railings. How many times had she painted these porches? she wondered. Or repaired the pergola, fixed the plumbing, trimmed the shrubs and trees? Living by the sea was a constant exercise in the art of nip and tuck, especially for an old cottage like Primrose. But she didn&#x2019;t mind the time or expense. She would repair and paint it every year she could still lift a paintbrush or afford a plumber. Because even more than the historic house on Tradd Street in Charleston, or the treasured, centuries-old family antiques that filled the Rutledge family&#x2019;s home, this modest 1930s beach house held the real memories of her family.<br><br>Only the good memories, she corrected herself with a wistful smile as her thoughts floated back to the halcyon days of her childhood.<br><br>When she was growing up, summer meant leaving the bustle and noise of Charleston and coming out to Primrose Cottage on the Isle of Palms with her mother, Olivia, and older brother, Palmer. It might have been only a trip across the Grace Bridge, some twenty miles, but back in the day, the change was so significant they might as well have journeyed to another country. Many of the girls she knew from school spent summers at family cottages on Sullivan&#x2019;s Island. But her mother claimed she preferred the relative isolation and the maritime forest on Isle of Palms. Cara, too, had preferred the Huck Finn lifestyle of Isle of Palms, where her mother would open the screen door and let her children run wild till the dinner bell at 5 p.m.<br><br>Cara sighed, slipping into the vortex of memories. Her gaze scanned the quaint cottage under the brilliant azure sky. She had achieved many lifetime firsts here. She&#x2019;d learned to swim on the beach just beyond the house, kissed her first boyfriend on the back porch, confided secrets with her best friend, Emmi, over cookies and sweet tea in the kitchen, broken her first bone falling from the live oak tree that thrived until Hurricane Hugo blew it down. She&#x2019;d caught her first fish from Hamlin Creek on the back of the island, and made love with Brett amid the clicking sea oats on the dunes. Of all her memories, those of the man she&#x2019;d fallen in love with late in life, married, and forged a new life with here on Isle of Palms were the sweetest.<br><br>Cara closed her eyes and took a deep breath, inhaling the sweet sea air. She heard the sounds of the island&#x2014;the soft humming of bees, the purr of the ocean. She felt the caress of a breeze ruffle her hair. Whenever she had memories of the beach house, the image of her mother formed in her mind. Olivia Rutledge, affectionately known as Lovie&#x2014;slight, ageless, her blond hair pulled back into a stylish chignon, her blue eyes shining with warmth. Opening her eyes, Cara almost expected to see her mother walking around the corner carrying the red turtle team bucket.<br><br>Primrose Cottage had been her mother&#x2019;s beach house. No, Cara thought on reflection. More than her house. The cottage had been her mother&#x2019;s sanctuary. Her place of refuge. Her source of inspiration. Lovie had come here to escape the burdens of her social obligations in Charleston. On the island she was free to pursue her passion&#x2014;sea turtles. Lovie had been the Isle of Palms&#x2019;s first &#x201c;sea turtle lady.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d formed the first turtle team. She&#x2019;d even named her only daughter Caretta, after the Latin name for the loggerhead, much to Cara&#x2019;s lifelong chagrin.<br><br>They&#x2019;d been close when she was young, but as Cara grew tall and statuesque, her opinions matured as well. She&#x2019;d found herself growing increasingly distant from her mother&#x2014;in fact, from both her parents.<br><br>Especially her father.<br><br>When Cara was eighteen, to her traditional father Stratton Rutledge&#x2019;s disappointment, she had refused to become the southern belle she was expected to be. Her hair was too dark, her feet too big. She was too tall, too bookish, and far too independent-minded. After graduating high school with honors, Cara had informed her parents, in a tone of voice that implied she was well aware they would not approve, that she wasn&#x2019;t going to the local college they&#x2019;d selected for her but would instead attend a northeastern college. Perhaps Boston University. Maybe even Harvard. She was proud she&#x2019;d been accepted. Her father, however, wasn&#x2019;t accustomed to back talk, especially from his daughter.<br><br>&#x201c;Who the hell do you think you are, little girl?&#x201d; he&#x2019;d roared, his voice echoing in the large dining room of their grand home. Her mother had sat quietly at the other end of the table, her eyes meekly downcast. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do as I say. And if you step one foot outside this town&#x2014;out of this house&#x2014;that&#x2019;ll tear it be-tween us, you hear? You leave and you&#x2019;ll not get one dollar, not one stick of furniture, not so much as a nod of the head when you pass me or your mother on the street, hear?&#x201d;<br><br>But Cara was more like her father than he&#x2019;d realized. She&#x2019;d turned heel and run as far away from her parents, that house, Charleston, and all the expectations and demands of a southern woman from South of Broad as she could get, heading to points north to seek her freedom, fame, and fortune. Her father was as good as his word. He&#x2019;d cut her off and never looked back. He refused to pay her tuition, so she&#x2019;d never gone to a prestigious Boston college. Instead she&#x2019;d nailed an inter-view for an entry-level position at an advertising firm in Chicago, and had gone to night school for seven years while working full-time, finally earning her degree in communications. She&#x2019;d climbed the corporate ladder and, though she wasn&#x2019;t wealthy, she&#x2019;d achieved success on her own merit. Cara had come home only once, for her brother&#x2019;s wedding, and sent a handful of Christmas and birthday cards over the years. There was the occasional phone call with her mother. Her relationship with her family was polite at best.<br><br>When her father died, Cara returned home for his funeral. Like the man he&#x2019;d been throughout his lifetime, his will was cold and vindictive. As Stratton had sworn all those years ago, he didn&#x2019;t leave her as much as a stick of furniture. Cara had neither expected nor wanted anything from him. But the silence from her mother upon finding out that he&#x2019;d made good on his pledge had hurt.<br><br>Then, on Cara&#x2019;s fortieth birthday, her mother had written asking her to come home for a visit. And she&#x2019;d obliged. A weekend at the beach house had turned into a summer of reconciliation.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Mama,&#x201d; she whispered so softly that her voice was carried off by the breeze. Cara had lost Lovie again to cancer right after they&#x2019;d found each other once more. Even after ten years, Cara&#x2019;s heart yearned for her.<br><br>Her father had left everything to Palmer. But the beach house was her mother&#x2019;s, and when Lovie died she&#x2019;d left it to Cara, knowing she would care for Primrose Cottage&#x2014;and all the secrets associated with it&#x2014;with the love and attention to detail that Lovie herself had exhibited. And Cara had fulfilled that promise.<br><br>But here she was, turning fifty, living on the Isle of Palms again, married to the love of her life and giving Primrose Cottage yet another coat of paint. &#x201c;What goes around comes around,&#x201d; her mother used to say. Cara chortled and shook her head. As usual, her mother was right.<br><br>Cara rolled her stiff shoulders, then traipsed across the sand and wildflowers to the waiting bucket of soapy water. She set her brush to soak, then put her hands on her back and once again stretched her aching muscles. Fifty certainly wasn&#x2019;t the new forty, not in Cara&#x2019;s opinion anyway.<br><br><i>No more daydreaming</i>, she told herself as her usual practical, no-nonsense attitude kicked in. Rental season was around the corner and there was a lot left to do&#x2014;and she couldn&#x2019;t afford to hire anyone else. She was committed to keeping the beach house up to the standards set by her mother. Still, she&#x2019;d miscalculated the strength of the early spring sun and she could feel the pinpricks of sunburn on her arms.<br><br>The sound of a car pulling up the gravel driveway distracted her. She stopped studying her arm and looked over her shoulder to see her brother&#x2019;s gleaming white Mercedes sedan easing to a stop. He gave a gentle toot of the horn to herald his arrival. She chuckled, thinking Palmer always arrived with fanfare. She removed the man&#x2019;s denim shirt irretrievably splattered with paint, one of Brett&#x2019;s rejects, from over her black T-shirt and tossed it on a nearby wheelbarrow. The front car door swung open and one polished slip-on tasseled loafer peeked out from the car, then Palmer Rutledge hoisted himself out with a muffled grunt.<br><br>At fifty-two, Palmer was two years older than Cara, but he looked a good decade older, thanks to the bloated, florid face and the paunch at his waist from his lifestyle as a businessman and successful real estate maven. While his habits had led to a less-than-healthy physique, Cara couldn&#x2019;t deny that Palmer had an enviable sense of style. Even as a boy he&#x2019;d always been an impeccable dresser, a sharp contrast to Cara&#x2019;s tattered, beachy sartorial choices. Today he wore a tan golf jacket over a polo shirt and pressed khakis. Cara wiped the flecks of paint from her hands onto her torn jeans and took a step toward him, a smile of welcome spread across her tanned face.<br><br>&#x201c;Palmer!&#x201d; she exclaimed with an exuberant wave. &#x201c;Come to see how the other half lives?&#x201d;<br><br>Her brother held out his arms and she walked into them for a bear hug, highlighting the physical ease and sense of closeness that they shared as children remained. Cara believed their mother&#x2019;s death had made them not simply orphans, but all too aware of their own mortality.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough of that,&#x201d; Palmer said with a low laugh, gently disentangling himself. &#x201c;You smell ripe, sister mine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Cara replied breezily, not in the least embarrassed. &#x201c;Comes from decent hard work.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mama never lifted a paintbrush in her delicate hands.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mama had more money than me. And, brother mine, I believe you do, too. So if the sight of my chipped nails and paint-splattered clothes offends you, kindly offer me the funds to hire out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to, honey, but we both know Julia spends every penny I earn faster than sand through fingers.&#x201d; Palmer rolled his eyes as he so often did when speaking of his socially conscious, designer-driven wife. His gaze shifted to the cottage. &#x201c;Nice job,&#x201d; he said. Then he slanted her a look. &#x201c;Do <i>you</i> hire out?&#x201d;<br><br>Cara slapped his arm teasingly. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get me started.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seriously,&#x201d; Palmer said, crossing his arms over his belly, &#x201c;the place looks good. Real good.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pretty place,&#x201d; she said, looking again at the beach house. And it was true. With its mullioned windows and broad porch filled with baskets of ferns and white rockers, she&#x2019;d always thought that it was a picturesque image of a lowcountry cottage. &#x201c;Say what you will about all these mansions,&#x201d; she said with another wave of her hand, indicating the enormous newer houses. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t buy that old-world charm.<br><br>&#x201c;You ever been in those big houses?&#x201d; Palmer teased. He looked around, searching. &#x201c;So where&#x2019;s your better half?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Brett is out back building a new pergola over the enclosed back porch. He&#x2019;s worked so hard on it. It&#x2019;s almost done, and I have to say it turned out so well.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; Palmer said, holding up his hand. &#x201c;What enclosed porch?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t seen it yet, have you?&#x201d; Cara asked in surprise. Though Palmer and Julia lived just over the bridge in Charleston with their two children, Linnea and Cooper, she and they didn&#x2019;t spend time together outside of family events and holidays. Cara doted on her niece and nephew, but with school and social schedules it seemed everyone was always too busy. &#x201c;Come on &#x2019;round. Brett will want to show it off. He did all the work himself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That man sure is handy,&#x201d; Palmer said as he followed her.<br><br>Cara knew he meant it as a compliment. Palmer had tried for years to get Brett involved in flipping houses, especially on the islands. But Brett was as stubborn as he was talented. He truly loved working with wood. He was as much a craftsman as a builder. Like so much else in his life, he did things his own way and wouldn&#x2019;t be hurried.<br><br>She led the way around the cottage, her shoes crunching in the dry sand and shells. Cara kept the property wild, as nature had intended. Only palm trees, wild grasses, and flowers sprouted on her property, especially in the spring, when the is-land was practically bursting with life. Wildflowers colored the dunes with soft yellows, vibrant blues, and fiery oranges. In the trees birds sang out mating calls, while overhead migrating birds soared, returning home from southern climes.<br><br>This side of the beach house faced the long stretch of dunes that reached out to the Atlantic Ocean. The mighty sea reflected the mood of the sky&#x2014;sometimes dark, turbulent, and gloomy, other times a soft, introspective gray-blue. Today the water was the color of unbridled joy and hope, a blue so vivid the horizon line disappeared where sea met sky, creating an infinite stretch of blue. Sunlight danced on the ocean, making it appear a living, breathing thing. Cara paused to stare out in awe. The dazzling sea always had the power to take her breath away.<br><br>&#x201c;Beautiful day,&#x201d; Palmer said with gusto, rocking back on his heels and echoing her thoughts.<br><br>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; she replied softly, sharing the moment with her brother.<br><br>&#x201c;And a stunning view. I&#x2019;ve always said that,&#x201d; he added, then gestured toward the ocean. &#x201c;No houses standing in the way. You&#x2019;ve got a straight shot to the sea with that vacant lot in front of you.&#x201d;<br><br>His words broke through her quiet reverie as she realized Palmer wasn&#x2019;t appreciating the spiritual quality of the view, but rather the commercial value. He spoke as if she didn&#x2019;t realize all these fine points of her own home. Going for the hard sell, as always. She turned her head to scrutinize him.<br><br>Her brother was, in fact, wearing business attire, she suddenly realized, not the sporty shorts and Tommy Bahama shirts he wore for leisure. His gold signet ring caught the sun-light and drew her attention to the papers he was carrying in his doughy hand. Cara sighed inwardly, even as she steeled her resolve.<br><br>This wasn&#x2019;t a social call. Palmer had come on business. Without speaking, she turned the corner of the house toward the back.<br><br>&#x201c;Whoa,&#x201d; Palmer exclaimed. He paused, hands on hips, to take in the new sunroom attached to the back of the house, the new deck spreading the entire width of the sunroom, with stairs leading out to the dunes. &#x201c;What have you and Brett been up to?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is what I wanted to show you,&#x201d; she replied, excited to show off the project that had dominated their lives the past several months. &#x201c;We enclosed the old porch and gained so much more space, all facing the ocean. We just love it. And then, of course, we will finish the deck. You can see the outline,&#x201d; she said, pointing to the wooden frame. &#x201c;It will spread the entire width of the sunroom with stairs leading out to the dunes. Mama would roll over in her grave if we didn&#x2019;t have a proper deck overlooking the ocean. And if you recall, Brett repaired Mama&#x2019;s pergola e...</p><h2>The Philosophy of Loyalty (Vanderbilt Library of American Philosophy)</h2><p>A transitional book in the development of Royce&#39;s thought, originally published in 1908, The Philosophy of Loyalty is a key to understanding his influence on the development of pragmatism. Royce&#39;s basic argument is clear. Individual wills are a given, and social training is a natural aspect of community.</p><p>Josiah Royce (1855-1916), one of the outstanding classical American philosophers, is regarded by many as the foremost American idealist. A transitional book in the development of Royce&#39;s thought, The Philosophy of Loyalty is a key to understanding his influence on the development of pragmatism. Royce&#39;s basic argument is clear. Individual wills are a given, and social training is a natural aspect of community. But the two are not fully compatible, and conflicts naturally emerge. Loyalty to a cause unites many individuals into a community, but fanatical loyalty to causes often has inimical results. Long out of print and never before available in paperback, The Philosophy of Loyalty has many beneficial implications for understanding contemporary social passions and outlooks, especially for our own fragmented American culture. As Royce himself asserted nearly ninety years ago, in the preface of this book, &#34;I am writing...not merely and not mainly for philosophers, but for all those who love...ideals, and also for those who love...their country - a country so ripe at present for idealism, and so confused, nevertheless, by the vastness and the complication of its social and political problems&#34;. Royce speaks to these continuing concerns in a voice that is perceptive, learned, and sensitive to the human situation, and he offers powerful conceptual tools for our own troubled times.John J. McDermott, author of the introduction to this new edition, is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Head of Humanities in Medicine at Texas A&amp;M University. He is the editor of five volumes of scholarly editions of the writings of William James, John Dewey, and Josiah Royce, as well as several textbooks and collections of philosophical essays.</p><h2>In the Hub of the Fiery Force: Collected Poems 1934-2003</h2><p>An acolyte of Whitman and Hart Crane, and companion and correspondent of W. H. Auden, Tennessee Williams, Charles Bukowski, Allen Ginsberg, Dylan Thomas, and James Baldwin, Norse has never received his due as one of America&#x2019;s most innovative yet accessible poets. William Carlos Williams called Norse &#x201c;the best poet of your generation&#x201d; and pushed Norse toward his groundbreaking work in &#x201c;the American idiom.&#x201d; Norse was also of the generation that challenged taboo subject matter in American poetry; his poems of gay love have been recognized as among the first and best of their kind. Norse&#x2019;s novella Beat Hotel described life with Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, and Gregory Corso in a run-down Parisian hotel. This retrospective, I Am In the Hub of the Fiery Force, is a collection of almost seventy years of his poetry, much of it previously unpublished, all of it unavailable. It will be recognized as the culmination of one of America&#x2019;s most vital lives in modern poetry.</p><p>Born a decade before Allen Ginsberg, Norse is much like him: a world traveler, knowledgeable about eastern religions, politically radical, a disciple of Whitman, forthrightly gay and rather a chicken hawk (that is, with a preference for quite young men), given to writing about himself with utter candor. But unlike Ginsberg, he writes straightforwardly. He may often drop punctuation and capitalization, but he doesn't delete articles and make his poems look like do-it-yourself shorthand dictation. Despite his self-centeredness, he isn't self-important or given to portentous prophesying with verbiage copped from Hindu and Buddhist rituals, which he knows but integrates into a genuinely winning poetic personality. Norse actually lived in the cities he writes about, not crashing with well-known names as Ginsberg did but staying in cheap hotels awash with bohemians, addicts, and petty crooks. He still isn't a millionaire, probably never will be, and the networks never call him. But in all his many poetic manners--rhymed or (mostly) not, in verse or prose--he is probably the best, most readable American gay poet. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I think of Rexroth, Patchen, and Bukowski at their freest. Like them Norse is not classifiable.&#34;</p><h2>Anuszkiewicz</h2><p>From the front flap of this 207-page book: &#34;Color is at once the most striking aspect of Richard Anuszkiewicz&#39;s art and the most profound, often forming the basis for his compositions. &#39;Color function becomes my subject matter&#39; he has said, &#39;and its performance is my painting.&#39; A major contemporary artist, Anuszkiewicz has long been noted for the cool geometry of his compositions, his impeccable technique, and, above all, the luminous, evocative shimmer of his colors. This book - the first to offer a comprehensive treatment of Anuszkiewcz&#39;s art - does full justice to his colors in 64 fine color reproductions.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>La Dolce Vita: Sweet Things from the Italian Home Kitchen (Mitchell Beazley Food)</h2><p><p>All the sweet things from the Italian table are brought together in this irresistible cookbook by hugely popular Italian chef and baker Ursula Ferrigno.

This volume covers the last decade, during which there has been continued instability and volatility, and much innovative development, in global financial markets. The context for this book is the growing divergence of informed opinion on how to interpret the rapid change in international money and finance. The profound disagreements which exist between the optimists and the pessimists illustrate the extent of the problem. Susan Strange gets to the heart of the current debates in official and business circles as well as among academics. Is the recent weakness of the US dollar merely a temporary and reversible phenomenon, or does it betoken a more profound weakness in the economy? Do the necessary political and economic conditions exist for international policy co-ordination between the three pillars of the triad - the US, Germany and Japan?

Through a historical presentation of the relation of English phonics to spelling, writing, and reading (this book) brings to teachers and reading researchers insights into the importance of phonics in education over several centuries. &#34;&#34;The Roots of Phonics&#34;&#34; follows the evolution of English phonics through the change wrought in it by centuries of diverse speakers, ensuing standardization, and the progression of different forms of phonics instruction (from the first edition). This is a classic in the field (Marcia Henry based her thesis work on it) that has gone out of print due to the acquisition of its original publisher. While Miriam is no longer active in the field, she participates in IRA, IDA, and SSSR. Bringing this book back to publication will introduce a whole new generation (many of whom were not taught to read using phonics) to this necessary resource. It has not really been updated since the last edition, other than a new foreword, a new note to the reader, and some new exercises that Tara created.</p><p>"I always keep this book within easy reach because I can rely on its accuracy, thoroughness, and detailed documentation of historical sources.

Suspects will include Oz's estranged wife, Lesley, (who'd do anything for daughter Olivia); Lesley's scapegrace brother, Ross; Edgar Timworth, a newly affluent literary agent who loves Lesley; and Josephine Jones, who stands to inherit Oz's job.

He had agreed to take the lead on this screwed-up mission.</p><p>The routine HAHO -- high altitude, high opening -- jump from a Câ?? 130 came with a standard set of risks. First, his team had to hit a tiny spot in the French Alps near St. Gervais. Second, a midnight op upped the ante. Last, parachuting into a snowstorm kicked in the high-octane factor.</p><p>And those weren't even the best reasons for labeling this op suicidal.</p><p>He stretched his legs and lifted a hand to scratch his face, but stopped. The Gentex face mask itched like a son of a bitch, but breaking the seal between skin and mask would immediately lower the raised nitrogen level in his blood. That meant he'd have to abort the jump and scrub the mission since this op was planned with a minimum number of operatives.</p><p>With the mood his three teammates had been in when they went wheels up, someone would immediately accommodate his wish for a quick death.</p><p>But they'd show some restraint since none of them wanted to waste a day off for his funeral.</p><p>Carlos checked his watch. Just after lunch on Sunday in the States. Headquarters should have new intel by now. He was ready to get moving as much as he hated making the jump.</p><p>He'd made the leap more times than he wanted to remember, but the stakes were high this time. The only thing worse than flying in an airplane was exiting one during flight...and at this altitude. An adrenaline junkie's dream. Not his.</p><p>He slapped a sideways look at Korbin Maximus, sitting next to him on another uncomfortable canvas seat. Their resident adrenaline junkie and insertion specialist for BAD -- Bureau of American Defense -- wore an identical oxygen mask. His night-vision goggles were shoved up on his forehead.</p><p>Slouched, eyes closed above a perpetual five-o'clock shadow, and arms casually crossed, Korbin appeared at rest, but Carlos knew their point man was not asleep.</p><p>"What's the matter, Korbin? Job puttin' you to sleep?" Reagan "Rae" Graham's British lilt came through the commo headset they all wore. Perched across from Carlos and Korbin, Rae was the only female on this op and no petite miss at five-eight. She could more than handle herself in hand-to-hand combat, cool as an ice cube under pressure. Few men would suspect the trim woman packaged with all those lush curves to be so lethal, but she was one tough babe from the short, sandy brown hair to a mile of legs...to the G36C rifle strapped across her chesty flight suit.</p><p>"Just reserving my strength for later." Korbin lifted a dark lash long enough to send a whispered wink at Rae.</p><p>"For the op or some sweet <i>thang</i>?" Rae chided in a poor imitation of his Texas drawl that sometimes carried shades of Korbin's Mexican heritage.</p><p>"I'm always up for a sweet thing, especially one loaded for bear." Korbin's eyes crinkled in challenge.</p><p>"Yeah, right. In your dreams." Rae flipped a droll don't-waste-your-time glance at him.</p><p>Carlos rolled his eyes at the pair. The banter and verbal poking had gone on for the past six months. Why hadn't they found a room yet? Should be a perfect match since both of them considered dinner reservations a long-term commitment.</p><p>BAD did have a "No fraternizing with team members" rule, which wouldn't normally faze most agency operatives, who considered breaking rules part of their job description.</p><p>But the first commitment of every agent in BAD was to protect teammates, which would be damn hard to do if one of the agents caught in cross fire was a loved one.</p><p>Carlos had no problem steering clear of relationships with females on a mission. Emotions complicated an op and jeopardized lives.</p><p>He'd learned that lesson the hard way and never made the mistake again. Never would.</p><p>"Besides, Korbin, you haven't made it to the R's yet," Rae piped up. "Who is it this week? Jasmine, Kelly, or Lisa?"</p><p>Korbin scowled, eyelids still at half-mast.</p><p>Rae's gaze twinkled with undisguised gloating over the direct hit.</p><p>"Is that what you're doing?" Gotthard Heinrich, the fourth operative, broke in. As the beefiest member of the team, he packed an easy 275-plus of solid muscle into that granite body and a temper not to be tested. "Gayle two weeks ago..." Above the clear oxygen mask, Gotthard's diamond-blue eyes narrowed in sharp concentration. "Haley last week...Isabelle...two days ago. Damn! You are working your way through da alphabet. You son-a-bitch." He spoke perfect English, French, German, Russian, and Italian whenever he wanted, a faint German accent slipping into his English only when in a secure situation.</p><p>"Thanks, Rae," Korbin growled, anything but appreciative.</p><p>"Hey. You're the one with the itch and a predilection for patterns."</p><p>"Must be nice to be single," Gotthard grumbled.</p><p>"Depends." Korbin shifted his slouch. "I don't have someone to go home to <i>every</i> night."</p><p>"Makes two of us." Gotthard dropped his head back, eyes shut.</p><p>Banter eased tension on a mission, but Carlos grimaced over Gotthard's slip. The few agents aware of the big guy's turbulent marriage also knew Gotthard did not discuss it openly.</p><p>BAD was a covert organization the U.S. government would never acknowledge that protected national security and saved lives, to put it in pretty terms, but the bottom line was they did whatever it took to get the job done. That way of life generally torpedoed serious commitments, in spite of a few couples that had managed to make cohabitating look possible. Most of the time even the best relationships fell victim as unavoidable casualties.</p><p>The one married teammate on this mission was slowly realizing that and getting an earful from his wife about being home for Thanksgiving in four weeks.</p><p>Wouldn't be so hard if Gotthard could tell his wife the real reason he'd missed the last two holidays. That he didn't really design interiors for aircrafts, but that sufficed as a cover.</p><p>Gotthard sat up, tense lines daggering the bridge of his nose.</p><p>"Incoming?" Carlos asked before he could stop himself, but he needed better intel, now. Gotthard had the only link to headquarters and had probably just gotten a vibration from his wrist unit.</p><p>The big guy gave a curt nod as he shoved the pale gray sleeve of his flight suit back, exposing his wrist video. The satellite-linked video device looked like an oversize square watch similar to the Vâ??Rambo unit worn by Israeli soldiers and alerted the wearer of an incoming message by vibrating.</p><p>But this electronic baby had been customized and developed just for BAD operations, all financed by a silent investor Joe knew. With a name like Joe Q. Public, no sense of humor when it came to his name, and a background most agents only speculated about in hushed conversations, no one questioned the director's supplier for BAD toys.</p><p>Gotthard was their communication specialist, who could all but talk to NASA with a piece of aluminum foil and tin can if they needed to reach an astronaut. When the wide-bodied agent finished reading the text on his arm piece, he lifted his gaze to Carlos, then his deep baritone came through the commo set.</p><p>"Heads up, everyone." Perfect English this time.</p><p>Korbin straightened next to Carlos, alert and ready. Rae cut her eyes at Gotthard, who continued once he had everyone's attention.</p><p>"New information is coming through in chunks. The transmissions are breaking up as we move between two satellites." Gotthard's gaze shot down to his wrist video. "Package...is confirmed missing from origin...stolen goods."</p><p>Carlos nodded when Gotthard glanced up to see that he understood. The <i>package</i> was Mandy Massey, the missing seventeen-year-old daughter of an American diplomat currently in Uruguay working on a military-site agreement the United States needed in that region. The diplomat thought his daughter was still traveling across South America with friends, but she was also known as a hellion who had disappeared from time to time from her private school in Europe.</p><p>BAD intercepted a kidnapping tip from an anonymous source known only as Mirage. The message indicating Mandy as a target of kidnappers had been sent with specific electronic markers, obviously meant for international intelligence agencies scanning for suspicious communication. BAD instituted a covert search across South America, which ended at the last place Mandy had been seen. Another electronic tip followed hours later, warning if the young girl went missing to look for her at a ch�teau in the St. Gervais area of the French Alps.</p><p>The BAD mission room had sounded more like a bar brawl in the making twelve hours ago when Joe first informed them of this jump. Carlos couldn't fault his companions for arguing against sending a team to jump into a blizzard when the missing renegade daughter had disappeared twice before then shown up later as if nothing were wrong. But the minute Joe shared that the second intercepted missive from Mirage stated Mandy would be given to something called a <i>fratelli</i>, the room had quieted, all agents ready to go.</p><p>Added to that, Mirage had been correct too many times to ignore the validity of the message. The very reason every intelligence agency in the world searched for this unknown person. No informant ever just shared intelligence freely.</p><p>They all had an agenda.</p><p>BAD needed to find out what Mirage stood to gain from sharing this information. What game was going on?</p><p>The team knew all too well that the reference to a <i>fratelli</i> in the tip could well mean the <i>Fratelli de il Sovrano</i>, which translated into Sovereign Brotherhood, number one on BAD's most-wanted list of dangerous organizations.</p><p>During the past year every agent had seen what this maniacal group could do to human beings. Men, women, and children had been used as guinea pigs for the Fratelli's biological terrorist attacks. The virus unleashed had turned the victims' bodies into hideous forms as they drew their last breaths pleading for death.</p><p>Making tonight's HAHO jump was no longer under debate with the chance of saving this young w...</p></p><h2>Fatal Charm: The Shocking True Story of Serial Wife Killer Randy Roth</h2><p>Smith, a prize-winning reporter for The Seattle Times, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in investigative reporting for his coverage of the Green River Killer case.

Bad times come when a hunting party that includes his father and clan chief is wiped out by a supernaturally aided attack, and Raif's open suspicion of the brutal new leader eventually drives him into exile. Meanwhile, Iss, overlord of Spire Vanis city, keeps a chained-up sorcerer whose powers he channels by revolting means, and has unexplained but shuddersome plans for his "foster daughter" Ash--herself an unwilling focus of dread forces.

Through illuminating studies of the leading men and women who forever changed our built environment, veteran architecture critic Martin Filler offers fresh insights into this unprecedented cultural transformation. From Louis Sullivan, father of the skyscraper, to Frank Gehry, magician of post-millennial museum, Filler emphasizes how their force of personality has had a decisive effect on everything from how we inhabit our homes to how we shape our cities.<br><br>Why was the sudden shift in architectural fashion that wrecked the career of the Scottish designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh not enough to destroy the indomitable spirit of Frank Lloyd Wright, who rose from adversity to become America&#x2019;s greatest architect? Why was Philip Johnson, &#x201c;dean of American architecture&#x201d; during the 1980s, so haunted by the superior talent of this less-fortunate contemporary Louis Kahn that he could barely utter his name even at the peak of his own success? How did Ludwig Mies van der Rohe&#x2019;s dictum &#x201c;Less is more&#x201d; give way to Robert Venturi&#x2019;s &#x201c;Less is a bore&#x201d;?<br><br>Surveying such current urban design sagas as the reconstruction of Ground Zero and the reunification of Berlin, Filler also trains his sharp eye on some of the biggest names in architecture today, puncturing more than one overinflated reputation while identifying the true masters who are now building for the ages.</p><p><b>Martin Filler</b> was born in 1948 and received degrees in Art History from Columbia. His writings have been published in more than thirty journals, magazines, and newspapers in the US, Europe, and Japan. Since 1985 his essays on modern architecture have appeared in <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, and he is now architecture critic of <i>House &amp; Garden</i>. Filler was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003. He and his wife, the architectural historian Rosemarie Haag Bletter, were guest curators for the Whitney Museum exhibition &#x201c;High Styles: Twentieth Century American Design&#x201d; (1985), and wrote the documentary film <i>Beyond Utopia: Changing Attitudes in American Architecture</i> (1983). They live in New York and Southampton, and have one son, Nathaniel."Most of these 17 short essays by Filler (architecture critic, <i>House &amp; Garden</i>) originally appeared in the <i>New York Review of Books</i>; some have been expanded and updated. They touch on aspects of the work and lives of 20-plus giants of modern architecture (e.g., Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier) as well as contemporary practitioners (e.g., Frank Gehry, Richard Meier)...Filler's engaging observations and insights are worth reading." -<i>-Library Journal</i><br><br>"Since the mid-1980s, <b>Martin Filler </b>has contributed a medley of long critical essays on architects and architecture to <i>The New York Review of Books</i>. A new book by that publisher released on July 17 collects and updates Filler's essays in a single offering entitled <b>Makers of Modern Architecture: From Frank Lloyd Wright to Frank Gehry. Arriving in time for the dog days, Filler provides something to sink our teeth into. Delicious!</b>...Filler's essays consist of a rich amalgam of biographical analyses, emphasizing each individual's career trajectory, with some formal analysis of the architects' built work. Refreshingly, he avoids too much of the latter, preferring to delve into matters often unexplored in the popular press. Along the way, we encounter quotable quotes, digressions, obsessions, professional sympathies, categorizations, personal prejudices, pronouncements, analogies, refutations, as well as political and social observations, and a rich, fulsome exercise of the English language.In our superficial era, when architectural criticism gasps for column inches in the newspapers, and blogs woefully lack erudition or research, Filler's assessments in The New York Review stand apart, eschewing fashion and offering polished, carefully edited and backed-up, though highly personal, assertions.says, clearly a fascination, if not minor obsession, of this New York-based writer...In the course of 300 pages, he engages 17 architects, including the Eamseses (positive review) and Calatrava (less sanguine), but manages to omit Robert Stern, Peter Eisenman, and Michael Graves, all 1980s rock stars, as well as a shopping list of current galactic lights such as Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas, Jean Nouvel, and Thom Mayne...Ultimately, Filler's engaging book entertains and informs as it opines; then the language ceases, leaving us hungering for more of this piquant, yet savory intellectual dish." --<i>Architectural Record</i><br><br>"Martin Filler's <i>Makers of Modern Architecture</i>...should eclipse other works in the field. He incisively places many 20th century architects and their work in a social context. He is also a refreshingly colorful, on-target observer, as when he limns, hilariously, the agonizing approach to (and his disappointment in) Richard Meier's Getty Center in Los Angeles, or notes that Louis Sullivan 'sometimes edged toward the crackpot in the relentless of his passionate obsessions.'" --House &amp; Garden<br><br>"Imagine a Vasari's <i>Lives</i> for architects, ranging from Louis Sullivan to Gehry, Piano, Calatrava. That's what Martin Filler has written with vivacity, concision, and encyclopedic erudition in <i>Makers of Modern Architecture.</i> If you're an old architectural hand, you'll need this book as an essential point of reference; if you're an avid amateur who wonders about the built world, you'll find it the best college course you never took. Filler's passionate observations on architecture and art, morality, commerce, and politics will ignite debates for years to come." --John Guare</p><h2>The Story of English: Revised Edition</h2><p>Tells the anecdotal history of the English language from its obscure Anglo-Saxon origins to its present status as the world&#39;s most prominent, expressive, and fast-growing international language</p><p>Robert McCrum is Books Editor of the Observer.

One such period was the first century C.E., when the rapid spread of Christianity with its claims about Jesus produced considerable ferment. The Gospel of John, written late in that century, presents that dispute with greater clarity than any other document of the time. John presents a Jesus who claims not only to tell the truth but also to <i>be</i> the truth. And yet, as the Roman magistrate asks Jesus in John's gospel, what is truth?<p>Two millennia later in the Western world, pluralism and postmodernism radically challenge traditional notions of truth. Is there any truth beyond the formal logic of merely analytical propositions? And if there is, do humans have any way of knowing it? Many who have a postmodern perspective deny that either rationality or imagination can give us access to the truth. Instead they adopt a thoroughgoing incredulity toward metanarratives. Truth is again on trial.</p><p>In <i>Truth on Trial: The Lawsuit Motif in John's Gospel, </i>Andrew T. Lincoln links reflection on contemporary issues with careful study of the Fourth Gospel. Exegetical chapters discern the shape of John's narrative and the function of the lawsuit motif within it, describe antecedent uses of the motif in Jewish Scripture, and set John's use of the motif in theological, historical, and social perspective. Closing chapters on contemporary application explore the pervasive power of the trial metaphor in Western literature in relation to recent hermeneutical thought. Over against modern and post modern views, Lincoln argues that Christians can simultaneously exercise critical judgement and accept John's testimony that Christ is the truth.</p></p><p><b>Andrew T. Lincoln</b> is Portland Professor of New Testament at Cheltenham and Gloucester College of Higher Education. Previously he was Lord and Lady Coggan Professor of New Testament at Wycliffe College, University of Toronto, and taught in the University of Sheffield. His previous publications include <i>Paradise Now and Not Yet</i> (Cambridge University Press, 1981), <i>Ephesians</i> (Word, 1990), <i>The Theology of the Later Pauline Letters</i> (Cambridge University Press, 1993), and <i>Colossians</i> New Interpreter's Bible; Abingdon, 2000).<p></p>"Scholars have long recognized John's use of the lawsuit motif, but to date there has been no definitive study of this motif. Lincoln has now filled that void. <i>Truth on Trial</i> is a masterfully comprehensive and perceptive work, leading the reader into the Isaianic background of the lawsuit motif, its development in the Gospel narrative, its social and theological significance, and its implications for contemporary hermeneutics. More than just the study of a motif, readers will discover here a demonstration of the adage that to do anything well one must do everything. Lincoln starts with a motif and ends up interpreting the Gospel."<br>&#x2014;R. Alan Culpepper, Dean, McAfee School of Theology, Mercer University<p>"Andrew Lincoln's <i>Truth on Trial</i> provides richly textured readings of the lawsuit motif in John as well as a series of thoughtful and profound theological reflections. This volume reflects Lincoln's thorough immersion in Johannine studies as well as his broad understanding of contemporary hermeneutical and theological issues. He never glosses over tough questions. Rather, his patient, clear prose, leads readers to a deeper engagement with matters concerning witness, testimony, confession, and truth. All Christian thinkers will benefit from wrestling with <i>Truth on Trial.</i><br>&#x2014;Stephen Fowl, Professor of Theology, Loyola College in Maryland</p><p>"In <i>Truth on Trial,</i> Andrew Lincoln deftly combines literary, historical, and theological approaches in a masterful and wide-ranging study of the lawsuit motif in the Gospel of John. Reading the Fourth Gospel against the backdrop of the lawsuits between God and Israel and God and the nations in Isaiah, the author freshly illumines John's reading of the Scriptures and repeatedly sheds new light on the Gospel's narrative and structure, theological world of thought, and historical context. Few recent studies on John can match the breadth and depth of insight with which Lincoln carries through his project."<br>&#x2014;Marianne Meye Thompson, Professor of New Testament Interpretation, Fuller Theological Seminary. -- <i>Review</i></p></p><h2>1954 Infinite Way Letters</h2><p>The 1954 Infinite Way Letters is the first in a series of regular monthly letters that Joel Goldsmith sent to Infinite Way students in fourteen countries around the world. These Letters of 1954 reflect the experiences that brought The Infinite Way into its fullness as a universal message. Today they continue to provide inspiration for anyone who is seeking a life of freedom and harmony, without limitation. Each letter is a lesson in spiritual living and provides instruction in specific spiritual principles that can be applied in daily experience. <br><br>In a 1958 lecture, Joel emphasized the importance of his monthly letters: Right now I m having an experience this week in this class, and it s only a very short period of time when it is going to appear in Letters because I want to share it with all those who are not here and all those who cannot hear the tape. I will put the very deepest things that I know into those letters compact them into five thousand words so that everybody who receives them can have the deepest that comes out of a class. Then at the end of twelve months, you can imagine what s in that book of twelve letters. There is nothing more precious in our entire library than the Infinite Way Letters of 54, 55, 56, and 57.</p><p>JOEL S. GOLDSMITH (1892-1964), a monumental teacher of practical mysticism, devoted most of his life to the discovery and teaching of spiritual principles which he founded and called The Infinite Way. After the publication of his seminal book, The Infinite Way, in 1947, Joel traveled throughout the world as a teacher and a healer. Although Goldsmith&#39;s message was neither organized nor advertised, students of The Infinite Way increased in numbers. Today, a worldwide student body exists which continues to practice and preserve his work. More than thirty books have been compiled from his tape-recorded lectures and classwork including &#34;The Infinite Way,&#34; &#34;Practicing the Presence&#34; and &#34;The Art of Meditation.&#34;</p><h2>The Beauty Myth</h2><p><p>The bestselling classic that redefined our view of the relationship between beauty and female identity</p><p></p><p></p><p>In today&#x2019;s world, women have more power, legal recognition, and professional success than ever before.

It&#x2019;s the beauty myth, an obsession with physical perfection that traps the modern woman in an endless spiral of hope, self-consciousness, and self-hatred as she tries to fulfill society&#x2019;s impossible definition of &#x201c;the flawless beauty.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Powerful....

Feminist Naomi Wolf argues that women&#39;s insecurities are heightened by these images, then exploited by the diet, cosmetic, and plastic surgery industries. Every day new products are introduced to &#34;correct&#34; inherently female &#34;flaws,&#34; drawing women into an obsessive and hopeless cycle built around the attempt to reach an impossible standard of beauty. Wolf rejects the standard and embraces the naturally distinct beauty of all women.Explores the phenomenon of the violent backlash against feminism that uses images of female beauty as a political weapon against women's advancement.<p> "<i>The Beauty Myth</i> is a smart, angry, insightful book, and a clarion call to freedom.

Jean O&#x2019;Malley Halley, a self-professed &#x201c;horse girl,&#x201d; contends that this relationship and its cultural signifiers influence the manner in which young girls define their identity when it comes to gender. Halley examines how popular culture, including the &#x201c;pony book&#x201d; genre, uses horses to encourage conformity to gender norms but also insists that the loving relationship between a girl and a horse fundamentally challenges sexist and mainstream ideas of girlhood.</p><p><i>Horse Crazy</i> looks at the relationships between girls and horses through the frameworks of Michel Foucault&#x2019;s concepts of normalization and biopower, drawing conclusions about the way girls&#x2019; agency is both normalized and resistant to normalization. Segments of Halley&#x2019;s own experiences with horses as a young girl, as well as experiences from the perspective of other girls, are sources for examination. &#x201c;Horsey girls,&#x201d; as she calls them, are girls who find a way to defy the expectations given to them by society&#x2015;thinness, obsession with makeup and beauty, frailty&#x2015;and gain the possibility of freedom in the process.</p><p>Drawing on Nicole Shukin&#x2019;s uses of animal capital theories, Halley also explores the varied treatment of horses themselves as an example of the biopolitical use of nonhuman animals and the manipulation and exploitation of horse life.

The history of DB by Elizabeth Hallam, assistant keeper at the PRO, tells general and scholarly audiences how the survey was made for William's administrative needs and used as a working record of English property-holding even into the last century. By then, however, DB had gained as well a long mythic history and played a continuing role in the English consciousness. This myth of Domesday explains Hinde's The Domesday Book , a strange compilation. After a token historical introduction (by Hallam, to be sure), a chapter for each of the thirty-seven traditional English counties in DB gives complete translation of the DB entry for three to five places, with a rambling little essay about later events there and then a "gazetteer" of other sites summarizing DB information and listing modern points of interest. This lavishly illustrated large-format popular history can be skipped by libraries, but college and public history collections will want Hallam's excellent study. Richard C.

Among them are: the story of Roy Vagelos championing an unprofitable drug that ultimately wiped out a debilitating disease in Africa; how flight director Eugene Kranz worked calmly and efficiently to return the endangered Apollo 13 astronauts safely back to Earth; and a look at Arlene Blum's pioneering all-woman ascent of the 26,545-foot Himalayan peak Annapurna in 1978. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>ARE YOU READY FOR THE LEADERSHIP MOMENT?<p>Merck's ROY VAGELOS commits millions of dollars to develop a drug needed only by people who can't afford it -- EUGENE KRANZ struggles to bring the Apollo 13 astronauts home after an explosion rips through their spacecraft -- ARLENE BLUM organizes the first women's ascent of one of the world's most dangerous mountains -- JOSHUA LAWRENCE CHAMBERLAIN leads his tattered troops into a pivotal Civil War battle at Little Round Top -- JOHN GUTFREUND loses Salomon Brothers when his inattention to a trading scandal almost topples the Wall Street giant -- CLIFTON WHARTON restructures a $50 billion pension system direly out of touch with its customers -- ALFREDO CRISTIANI transforms El Salvador's decade-long civil war into a negotiated settlement -- NANCY BARRY leads Women's World Banking in the fight against Third World poverty -- WAGNER DODGE faces the decision of a lifetime as a fast-moving forest fire overtakes his firefighting crew</p></p><h2>The Museum of Dr. Moses: Tales of Mystery and Suspense</h2><p>In "The Man Who Fought Roland LaStarza" a woman&#x2019;s world is upended when she learns the brutal truth about a family friend&#x2019;s death&#x2014;and what her father is capable of. Meanwhile, a businessman desperate to find his missing two-year-old grandson in "Suicide Watch" must determine whether the horrifying tale his junky son tells him about the boy&#x2019;s whereabouts is a confession or a sick test. In "Valentine, July Heat Wave" a man prepares a gruesome surprise for the wife determined to leave him.

Br�gh an �rain - A Story in Every Song corrects this, showing how the inherited art of a fourth-generation Canadian Gael fits within biographical, social, and historical contexts. It is the first major study of its kind to be undertaken for a Scottish Gaelic singer. The forty-eight songs and nine folktales in the collection are transcribed from field recordings and presented as the singer performed them, with an English translation provided. All the songs are accompanied by musical transcriptions. The book also includes a brief autobiography in Lauchie MacLellan&#39;s entertaining narrative style. John Shaw has added extensive notes and references, as well as photos and maps. In an era of growing appreciation of Celtic cultures, Br�gh an �rain - A Story in Every Song makes an important Gaelic tradition available to the general reader.

Reeves scored hits with the anthemic ``Dancing in the Street,'' the rollicking ``Heat Wave,'' and the gutsy ``Nowhere to Run (Nowhere to Hide).'' Her father was a sharecropper and, like many Southern blacks, brought his family to Detroit after WW II in search of a better life. In high school, Reeves formed the Del- Phis, and they cut one local single. When she lucked into a job as a secretary at fledgling Motown Records, she began working as a background singer with two of her friends; the trio was soon renamed Martha and the Vandellas. They toured with the first ``Motortown Revue''; Reeves tells of performing for a segregated house in the South: ``We [sang] all of the songs twice; once in one direction, and the same song about-face.'' She crossed paths with many Motown legends, from Marvin Gaye (whom the Vandellas accompanied on many early recordings) to Mary Wells, the Temptations, and Smokey Robinson, but tells little about their personalities or their music. Those hoping for catty details of how young ``Diane'' Ross pushed her way into the spotlight will find only the occasional crumb. ``Diane [stole] onstage adlibs from everyone,'' Reeves complains, going on to assert that the Supremes once copied the Vandellas' gowns, forcing them to quickly come up with new outfits. She gives only a sketchy description of her descent into pill addiction and the bad LSD trip that precipitated a late-'60s nervous breakdown. Her ``comeback'' in the '80s and '90s has mostly consisted of rehashing her old hits. Motown historians will glean little new about Reeves's life; fans of the kiss-and-tell genre will be disappointed by the dearth of dirt. (Three 8-page b&amp;w photo inserts, not seen) (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In the early '60s Martha and the Vandellas were among the most successful female pop acts in the world; by the end of the decade they had largely been upstaged by Motown labelmates Diana Ross and the Supremes. Writing with Bego ( Madonna: Blonde Ambition ), Reeves here recounts both the excitement and energy of Motown in its heyday and her frustrations in making a comeback after she was abandoned by music industry moguls. Although she proclaims to set the record straight about her alleged feuds with Diana Ross and Motown president Berry Gordy, Reeves tends to soft-pedal these issues, and her feelings about Gordy are so obviously conflicted as to leave readers befuddled about their true relationship. Consequently, the book is of interest more as an account of a career in the entertainment industry than as an expose of the Motown scene. Reeves's story of her exploitation by her managers, her ongoing drug addiction and a string of relationships gone sour is poignant, and she emerges as a stoic and likable survivor.

Mencken is still one of the most enlightening. Mencken wrote this book while still in his 20s, but his penchant for thoroughness was evident even at that young age&#x2014;in preparation for writing this book, he read Nietzsche's works in their entirety, mostly in the original German. A brief biographical sketch is followed by clear and thorough explanations of Nietzsche's basic concepts and attitudes. Analyzed are Nietzsche's much-misunderstood concept of the superman, his concept of eternal recurrence, his rejection of Christianity, and his basic rationalism and materialism. Included are two essays on Nietzsche that appeared in Mencken's magazine <i>The Smart Set</i> subsequent to the publishing of the original edition of this book. Nearly a century after its original publication, this remains one of the clearest, most concise, and entertaining introductions to Nietzsche to date.<br></p><p><b>H. L. Mencken</b> was a journalist in the first half of the 20th century, reporting on social and political matters such as the Scopes Trial. He was the editor of <i>The Smart Set</i> and <i>The American Mercury</i> and the author of over two dozen books, including <i>The American Language</i>, <i>Happy Days</i>, <i>Newspaper Days</i>, and <i>Heather Days</i>.

Nietzsche describes in this book how from Socrates onward the Apollonian had dominated Western thought, and raises German Romanticism as a possible reintroduction of the Dionysian to the salvation of European culture...</p><p></p><h2>Six-Man Football</h2><p>This volume, that Jack Pardee terms a dissertation on six-man football, is not only the definitive rule book for the sport, but includes a thorough sixty-five-year history of Texas six-man competition, the teams that have played, and the coaches who have developed and led them. Because of the continual sprinting, dodging, and aggressive contact demanded in every one of the forty minutes of play, six-man games are won on conditioning. For this reason, the book includes a chapter titled Getting the Team Ready Physically. Strategies for offense and defense are detailed, including the O&#39;Brien Wing Set and the O&#39;Brien Veer, with input, also, for specialty teams. The playbook of over 250 offensive plays from various Texas six-man offensive formations will prove useful to those who compete in the game of six-man football.</p><p>C. H. Underwood is a life-long educator who first played six-man football while a student at O&#39;Brien (Texas) High School, where in 1962 his team was the undefeated regional champion. After graduating from Midwestern State University, he returned to teach at O&#39;Brien and to coach six-man football.&#34;[Six-man football] is in many ways more strenuous than 11-man ... demanding better physical conditioning ... and making for extremely aggressive contact. Football fans who enjoy good open-field running, blocking and tackling enjoy the six-man game as played in Texas today.&#34;</p><h2>Scholastic Spelling Grade 2</h2><p>A nice practice book for youngsters.</p><p></p><h2>Emily Dickinson: Selected poems / [introduction by Christopher Moore]</h2><p>1993 Random House Value hardcover, Emily Dickinson (The Gorgeous Nothings: Emily Dickinson&#39;s Envelope Poems).

Scott lived in the Amish and Mennonite community in Holmes County, Ohio, for a year. In 1969 he attended the Numidia Mennonit Bible School in Pennsylvania and the same year began two years of alternate service at Lancaster Mennonite High School in Pennsylvania. During this time, Scott joined the Old Order River Brethren Church, one of the consrvative Anababptist groups. In 1973 he married Harriet Sauder.

Worn down by the responsibility of caring for the invalids, he is tempted to hop a train to Montana. A chance encounter with a hobo who is ill and the decision to seek medical aid for him teaches Teddy that heroism has many different meanings. Dodson's black-and-white sketches nicely complement the story's events. However, even though Kudlinski has utilized her grandmother's reminiscences for background on the period, her effort to depict the influenza epidemic is not successful, for she does not develop the strong sense of time and place that historical fiction demands. She states the time frame and uses slang appropriate to the period, but these are not enough to create a strong setting. --Therese Bigelow, Hampton Public Library, VA<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>To the Rescue: Found Dogs with a Mission</h2><p>Animal-adoption advocate Elise Lufkin and <i>Time</i> photographer Diana Walker celebrate the bond between once-abandoned dogs and their adoptive humans in their first two heart-warming, collaborative books. Their third collection, <i>To the Rescue</i>, takes those happing endings one step further. This book celebrates those remarkable found&#x201d; dogs (and one cat) who were rescued, sometimes literally from death row, who have gone on to become not simply contented pets, but therapy, service, and even highly trained search-and-rescue animals. In these dogs, their human adopters found a spark of something exceptional: a wellspring of unconditional love, a drive to channel into a unique skill, or a disability that could inspire. Indeed, some of the dogs profiled are missing limbs, or are the survivors of severe abuse or neglect, but they fulfill their jobs with boundless enthusiasm.<br><br><i>To the Rescue</i> features therapy dogs who visit nursing homes, hospitals, and hospice rooms. Some are patient reading partners for children. Others offer comfort and confidence to at-risk teens, and inspiration to injured veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Others are search-and-rescue dogs, hunting for human scent in avalanches, or helping investigators at arson sites and disaster sites including the Pentagon after 9/11.<br><br>These brave animals have repaid the kindness of their rescuers in spades, bringing love, acceptance, hope, and solace to people in need. Once again, they raise the question: just who has rescued whom?</p><p><b>Elise Lufkin</b> has been involved with dogs all her life.

Her photographs are in the collections of the Smithsonian&#x2019;s National Museum of American History and the National Portrait Gallery.In their third collaboration, Animal adoption activist Lufkin (Not Bartlett's) and Time magazine photographer Walker profile the adoptive owners of working dogs, 53 in all, who serve the public and law enforcement officials as certified therapy animals, guides for the disabled, bomb detectors, drug sniffers, and other roles: Rusty is a Golden Retriever mix who visits second graders in an English-as-a-second-language class; Roxy helps her wheelchair-bound owner by opening containers and doors; Micah is a white German shepherd who aids emergency officials in search and rescue situations. Long-shot stories abound, such as the tale of Sophia, a Mexico City street dog who wound up in the U.S., bringing comfort to hospice patients; tissues required. Beginning with a foreword by actor and talk show host Bonnie Hunt, each warm, heart-felt story builds on the last, and includes fitting photos (though readers may wish they were bigger and more numerous). This feel-good book should please animal- and dog-lovers, especially those who live with a working dog. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Historians and theologians have at different times come to varying conclusions, based on the same fundamental writings of Luther. Enthusiastic followers of the Reformer, in their efforts to convince others, have from time to time fallen into the temptation to oversimplify his teachings. Spiritus Creator is the answer to this confusion. Laying aside the numerous interpretations of others, Regin Prenter, a noted Danish Theologian and scholar, presents Luther&#39;s thought itself. In this study he does not ask where Luther&#39;s thoughts came from, or how they developed; he asks only what Luther thought. Questioning, for example, whether Luther&#39;s view of the Holy Spirit was really so traditional, so much colored by medieval thought patterns as has been widely assumed, Dr. Prenter shows how Luther used Augustinian terms - the vocabulary of his age - yet gave them new content, even new definitions. He demonstrates how Luther&#39;s concept of the Holy Spirit did indeed take shape in a traditional form but that it then grew into what is for all Protestants a crucial, evangelical insight. Spiritus Creator is divided into two parts: the concept of the Holy Spirit before Luther had to defend his teachings from the distortions of enthusiasts, and this same concept during his struggle with the enthusiasts. This pattern gives the author opportunity to present the basic statements of the early period without reference to the polemical situation of Luther&#39;s later life.

However, when at last all appeared to be under control, a catastrophe erupted that claimed the lives of 10,000 legionnaires and laid Rome&#x2019;s imperial ambitions for Germania into the dust. <br><br>In late September of 9 AD, three Roman legions, while marching to suppress a distant tribal rebellion, were attacked in a four-day battle with the Germanic barbarians. The Romans, under the leadership of the province&#x2019;s governor, Publius Quinctilius Varus, were taken completely by surprise, betrayed by a member of their own ranks: the German officer and secret rebel leader, Arminius. The defeat was a heavy blow to both Rome&#x2019;s military and its pride. Though the disaster was ruthlessly avenged soon afterwards, later attempts at conquering the Germans were half-hearted at best. <br><br>Four days in September thoroughly examines the ancient sources and challenges the hypotheses of modern scholars to present a clear picture of the prelude to the battle, the fighting itself and its aftermath.</p><p>Jason R. Abdale received his BA cum laude and MA in History at Queen&#39;s College.

Excerpt: ...gar-5 Pol. 11. j.ison of Eryx should lay down their arms, and for pake Sicily, threatening, that otherwise he would not talk of any composition; Hamilcar boldly bade him chuse, whether he would talk of it or no; for that the arms which his country had put into his hands to use against her enemies, it was not his purpose to yield up unto them. Now since the Romans, contrary to their custom upon like advantages, were content to let Hamilcar have his will, and not to stand with him upon point of honour, whilst they hight quietly rid their hands of him; plain enough it is, that they were far from thinking him a man consumed with miseries, as Fabius would have him seem. Hereunto agrees the relation of.Polybius, who flatly, and by name, chargeth Fabius with untruth; saying, that howsoever Hamilcar, and his soldiers, had endured all extremity, yet they behaved themselves as men that had no sense thereof, and were as far from being either vanquished, or tired, as were their enemies, Such being the difference between Fabius (as also perhaps between other old writers of the Roman story) and those that had more regard of truth, than of nattering the mighty city of Rome; we must take it in good part, that howsoever Livy introduceth Hanno, in one place, joining very foolishly his own shameful overthrow at the islands.Egates, with the great services of Hamilcar at Eryx, as if both of them had had a like event; yet elsewhere 7 he forbcareth not to put a more likely tale (though with as impudent a commemoration of his own unhappy conduct) into the same Hanno&#39;s mouth; making him say, that the affairs of Carthage never went better than a little before the loss of their fleet in that battle at sea wherein himself was general.

In a haunting and hugely readable study, Michael Newton deftly investigates a number of infamous cases. He looks at Peter the Wild Boy, who gripped the attention of Swift and Defoe, and at Victor of Aveyron, who roamed wild in the forests of revolutionary France. He tells the story of a savage girl lost on the streets of Paris, of two children brought up by wolves in the jungles of India, and of a Los Angeles girl who emerged from thirteen years locked in a room to international celebrity. He describes, too, a boy brought up among monkeys in Uganda; and in Moscow, the child found living with a pack of wild dogs.<br><br><i>Savage Girls and Wild Boy</i>s examines the lives of these children and of the adults who &#x201c;rescued&#x201d; them, looked after them, educated, or abused them.

Three teenage investigators on the West Coast--Jupiter (the Brain), Pete (the Jock) and Bob (Mr. Cool)--use their talent for solving crimes. Stereotypical Hispanic hoodlums, part of a "Latino La Bamba" (that is, salsa) band, are being used as muscle by a record promoter-gone-bad. The case moves quickly to a close; before long, the investigators have put their judo and karate training to use and have captured the bad guys, to the surprise of the local police.

Winner of the 1990, James Madison Award of the American Political Science Association, he is also the author of <em> Moral Judgement</em>.</p>A slow-paced but utterly intriguing examination of the development of the ``moral sense'' that governs human conduct in all cultures and times. Wilson (Management and Public Policy/UCLA; On Character, 1991, etc.) contends that most modern sociologies and psychologies are flawed insofar as they maintain that there's no such thing as an identifiable ``human nature'' that will develop under most circumstances without external coercion. The legal theories of John Rawls, the political agendas of Marx and Lenin, and much of Freudian psychology were organized around this idea--which Wilson claims to be demonstrably false. Basing his own theory upon a large body of experimental research, Wilson holds that the development of empathy, conscience, and altruism is a natural process that takes place as an inevitable response to the contradictions of childhood socialization. ``We learn to cope with the people of this world,'' Wilson says, ``because we learn to cope with the members of our family.'' The family is the crucial element in the process, and Wilson points to the weakening of the family bond as the root of most of today's social dysfunctionalism. Parts of his argument- -particularly his pessimism regarding the effects of nonmaternal child care--will be a provocation to orthodox feminists, but there's nothing doctrinaire or simplistic in Wilson's critique of our current wisdoms. (His extensive notes and bibliography will be useful to scholars interested in the field.) Dry and overly anecdotal at times, but Wilson manages to take sociology out of the realm of theory without reducing it to policy.

Some Christians answer with a cheerful "Yes," seeing it as the sum of the Christian life. Others believe we should rely on the work of Christ alone, throwing off any hint of the moralism or "works righteousness" they associate with imitating Jesus. Jason Hood takes us on a tour of what the Bible has to say about imitating Jesus. He draws our attention to what Paul told the Corinthians he taught "everywhere in every church." And after following the theme throughout the New Testament, he looks at it from a historical and contemporary perspective. The result is the recovery of a biblical pattern for life&#x2015;one that challenges the assumptions of those who excessively <em>fear</em> moralism as much as it challenges the assumptions of those who embrace it. Here is a reliable theological foundation for imitating Jesus today, a crucial first step toward the renewal of biblical discipleship.</p><p>Jason B. Hood (Ph.D., Highland Theological College and University of Aberdeen) is currently an adjunct faculty member at Reformed Theological Seminary in Washington, DC. He teaches biblical theology of mission in correlation with the Memphis Fellows Initiative. Hood is also the Scholar-in-Residence at Christ United Methodist Church and director of Christ College Residency Program, an intensive discipleship training program for college students. He and his wife and three children reside in Memphis."Jason Hood has that rare ability to combine scholarly thinking with clear and approachable writing. The footnotes are rich and the dialogue is fresh and compelling. <em>Imitating God in Christ</em> is a message we desperately need to hear today! The pendulum of knowing and obeying is swinging wildly across the Christian spectrum, but Hood has found the plumb line by taking seriously the Word of God. I am excited to see the fruit of this book in the kingdom of God." (David Arthur, CEO of Precept Ministries)<br><br>"Jason Hood, in this well-written and well-crafted volume, has presented readers with a powerful and persuasive call to reconsider what it truly means for Christians to be imitators of God in Christ. Hood calls for the church to recover the important and oft-neglected scriptural teaching regarding the historical practice of imitation in order to bring about authentic Christ-centered discipleship and cross-shaped sanctification. In doing so, he winsomely points his readers toward renewal, faithfulness, Christlikeness and godliness, not as a grueling duty, but as a delightful destiny. I am hopeful for and enthusiastic about Hood's proposal and pray that it receives the wide readership and response it deserves." (David S. Dockery, president, Union University)<br><br>"In this very readable and accessible book Jason Hood provides not only an introduction but even more, a biblical theology of imitation. Hood situates his discussion thoughtfully in the context of the broader themes of the image of God, sanctification and discipleship, while rightly calling us to rediscover the key biblical idea of following the example of Jesus and his disciples. I hope this book will continue to stimulate this important discussion." (Jonathan T. Pennington, associate professor of New Testament, Southern Seminary)<br><br>"Jason Hood has given the Reformed and evangelical communities--and indeed all Christians--an extraordinary gift in this book on imitation as a practice that is at the heart of Christian existence. It is well researched but highly readable, theologically deep as well as spiritually uplifting, prophetic without being preachy. It seeks to overcome the unfortunate divides in certain circles between Jesus as Savior and Jesus as example, and between imitation and participation. I recommend it strongly both for its biblical theology and for its spirituality." (Michael J. Gorman, Raymond E. Brown Professor of Biblical Studies and Theology, St. Mary's Seminary &amp; University, Baltimore)<br><br>"In an accessible and engaging book, Hood invites us to reconsider an important biblical theme--imitation of God in Christ. Focusing on three spheres--imitation of the God of Israel, imitation of the incarnate Christ and imitation of the saints--Hood demonstrates that imitation is not limited to a handful of passages in the Gospels and Paul. To the contrary, it represents a pervasive theme in Scripture. <em>Imitating God in Christ</em> is not merely an exercise in biblical theology. One of the great strengths of this book is the way Hood draws attention to contemporary distortion of Scriptural teaching on imitation (e.g., a false dichotomy between Jesus as example and Jesus as savior) and offers helpful correctives." (Keith E. Johnson, director of theological education, Campus Crusade for Christ, author of Rethinking the Trinity and Religious Pluralism)<br><br>"Radical grace cannot be reductive grace. Jason Hood reminds us that any account of the new creation in Christ must attend to the call to imitate God in Christ. Jesus was the faithful one--the true human who trusted his Father to the bitter end, who ministered in the power of the Spirit and who gave himself sacrificially for the life and flourishing of others, even his enemies--and we are called to follow him in all these ways. Jesus is not only our substitute, but he is also the shape of the human in the new creation. <em>Imitating God in Christ</em> addresses these issues with clarity, insight and faithfulness." (Michael Allen, Kennedy Associate Professor of Systematic Theology, Knox Theological Seminary, Fort Lauderdale, Florida)<br><br>"The long lost discipline of the<em> imitatio Christi </em>is persuasively and poignantly recaptured here by Jason Hood. Through a panoramic survey of Scripture, Hood shows us that imitation is the highest form of adoration. He challenges Christians to truly live as Jesus, not with cheesy clich�s or with theological shallowness, but in cruciformed likeness to the Lord Jesus. But beware! This book will disturb folks from the lethargy of a mediocre spirituality, and rightly so!"

During a game the decision to give up material in order to get an advantage is probably the most difficult one a player has to take. Often, you have to burn your bridges without being able to fully calculate the consequences. Risks and rewards are racing through your mind, fighting for precedence while the clock keeps ticking. Now is the moment, because after the next move the window for this opportunity may be closed. In this book Ivan Sokolov presents a set of practical tools that will help you to master the art of sacrifice. By concentrating on the aim you are trying to achieve, rather than on the opening you are playing or the piece you might be going to sack, he teaches you how to come to a reasonable risk assessment and how to trust your intuition. There is a separate part on seizing the initiative without actually giving up material. Ivan Sokolov has written an entertaining and instructive guide, packed with useful advice and lots of practical examples.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><td>Ivan Sokolov is a top grandmaster who was born in Bosnia in 1968.

The late 1960s. It's Christmastime and Jack Carter is the top man in a crime syndicate headed by two brothers, Gerald and Les Fletcher. He&#x2019;s also a worried man. The fact that he&#x2019;s sleeping with Gerald&#x2019;s wife, Audrey, and that they plan on someday running away together with a lot of the brothers&#x2019; money, doesn&#x2019;t have Jack concerned.

After graduating from Hull Art School, Lewis moved to London and first worked in advertising before becoming an animation specialist, working on the Beatles&#x2019; <i>Yellow Submarine</i>. His novels are the product of his lifelong fascination with the criminal lifestyle of London&#x2019;s Soho district and the down-and-out lifestyle of the English factory town. Lewis' novels pioneered the British noir school. He is the author of nine novels, the second of which was famously adapted in 1971 as the now iconic <i>Get Carter</i>, which stars Michael Caine.<b>Praise for <i>Jack Carter's Law</i><br></b><br><b>A <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> Best Book of 2014</b><br><br>"Carter is no hero, killing rival villains without compunction, manipulating one and all (male or female) to his advantage.

With insight and sharp detail, Brakhage puts the lives and works of these filmic visionaries into personal focus. We meet Jerome Hill, born to inherit railroads and banks but destined to forge his artistic vision into a lasting film statement. And Marie Menken who, against the odds of a miserable and brutal marriage, developed a film aesthetic that revolutionized the very essence of independent filmmaking. Then James Broughton, the inveterate San Franciscan, whose irrepressible sense of whimsy and profound grasp of classical symbols combined to create some of the most vital filmworks of the last four decades; Christopher MacLaine, the "Artaud of North Beach"; Maya Deren, known to independent filmmakers as "the mother of us all"; Sidney Peterson, sophisticated, erudite, shy, the gentleman of the avant-garde film world; and two of Brakhage's most prominent contemporaries, Bruce Conner and Ken Jacobs. <p> These filmmakers are members of one of the most radical of 20th-century art movements; and yet as radical and individual as they are, their films and their lives are a continuous source of inspiration, not only to young, developing film-artists, but to the makers of commercial movies and videos as well. Brakhage presents them and their work in portraits that are at once critical and anecdotal. One comes away from Film at Wit's End as one leaves an enjoyable, lively evening among friends.</p></p><p>During his lifetime Stan Brakhage was himself one of the most influential of American independent filmmakers: from 1952 until his death in 2003, he created over 400 original works. His books on film include Metaphors on Vision, Film Biographies, Brakahge Scrapbook: Collected Writings 1964-1980, Essential Brakhage (selected writings), and Telling Time: Essays of a Visionary Filmmaker.

Reprint.</p><p>Romance readers around the world were sad to note the passing of Betty Neels in June 2001.Her career spanned thirty years, and she continued to write into her ninetieth year.To her millions of fans, Betty epitomized the romance writer.Betty&#x2019;s first book, Sister Peters in Amsterdam,was published in 1969, and she eventually completed 134 books.Her novels offer a reassuring warmth that was very much a part of her own personality.Her spirit and genuine talent live on in all her stories.The bright sunshine of early May, pouring through the latticed windows of the old house, shone on to the short dark curls of the girl bent over the case she was packing with a kind of controlled ferocity.<p>She was young, built on Junoesque lines, and tall with a lovely face and dark eyes heavily fringed with black lashes. The face was marred at the moment by her heavy frown.</p><p>'I cannot think what Granny is about,' she observed to the middle-aged lady&#x2014;an older, gently faded version of herself sitting and watching her. 'Mother, she is eighty years old; why on earth does she want to go trekking across the Highlands of Scotland...?'</p><p>'Not trekking, Rosie&#x2014;she won't have to move from the train if she doesn't wish to!' Mrs Macdonald heaved a sentimental sigh. 'I think it is rather touching that she should want to see the surroundings of her childhood.'</p><p>'Well, she won't see much from the train.' Rosie then added because of her mother's unhappy look, 'Well, if it makes her happy. But why me? There's Aunt Carrie...'</p><p>'Your granny and Aunt Carrie don't get on, dear. It is only for a week, and I dare say there will be some interesting people on the train.' She paused. 'Aren't you going to take the cream jersey? You look so nice in it, and it doesn't take up any room...</p><p>'Anyway, you never know,' continued her mother vaguely, and Rosie, guessing her parent's thoughts, said baldly,</p><p>'There will be Americans on the train, Mother, and possibly a German or two, all married and over fifty.'</p><p>'Oh, I do hope not,' said Mrs Macdonald. She had never quite understood why Rosie, at twenty-five, was still unmarried. She was as pretty as a picture, had any number of friends and, to her mother's knowledge, had turned down&#x2014;in the nicest possible manner&#x2014;several offers of marriage.</p><p>'Don't you want to get married?' she voiced her thoughts out loud.</p><p>'Oh, yes, Mother, dear. But I haven't met him yet..'</p><p>'There was that nice Percy Walls,' said Mrs Macdonald.</p><p>'Pooh!' replied Rosie strongly. 'He only talked about food and how clever he was. If I had married him I would have been a doormat, everlastingly cooking snacks.'</p><p>'He did like his food,' conceded Mrs Macdonald, 'but he was keen on you, darling.'</p><p>'Just because I can cook.' Rosie rolled up a pleated skirt in a ruthless fashion, and stuffed it into her case. 'Very surely being keen isn't enough, Mother. The man I marry must dote on me, cherish and love me for always, even when I'm bad-tempered or sneezing my head off.' She closed the case, and added briskly, 'I don't imagine there is such a man...'</p><p>'He sounds worth waiting for,' said Mrs Macdonald. 'I must admit that a man's love can be tried to the utmost when one has a heavy cold. Though I must say that your father is an exception.' She sounded a little smug, and Rosie laughed and dropped a kiss on her mother's cheek as she went to the dressing-table. 'Mother, Father is the nicest man I know. How much money shall I need to take, do you think?'</p><p>'Your granny said not to take any, but I think you had better take some; she forgets sometimes. Are you not looking forward to this trip at all, love?'</p><p>'Well, it will be nice to be in Scotland again, only a week isn't long enough&#x2014;I'd love to stay up in the Highlands for a long time, walk perhaps, or drive around. But I've only got two weeks' holiday, and Miss Porter wants to go away in June, so I'll have to be there to do some of her work.'</p><p>Rosie had spoken cheerfully; she disliked her job as a shorthand typist at Messrs Crabbe, Crabbe and Twitchett, the leading solicitors in the small country town in Wiltshire where she lived, but she had never said so; her father had lost almost all of his capital some years previously when the shares he held became almost worthless, and in order to keep his home in Scotland intact he had handed it over to a cousin and taken the job of agent on a large estate in Wiltshire. Neither he nor her mother had ever complained, although Rosie knew that they missed their home as much as she did. She had set about learning shorthand and typing, got herself a job, and consoled herself with the thought that their home in Scotland was, at least, still in the family.</p><p>Her grandmother lived in edinburgh with her unmarried daughter who was older than Rosie's father&#x2014;a wispy lady who was seldom able to complete a sentence, and was possessed of a meekness which irritated the old lady, a forceful person who browbeat her despite the care Aunt Carrie took of her. Rosie was able to see her very seldom; the journey to Scotland was expensive and long, and she suspected that her parents were reluctant to visit their old home now that her father's cousin lived there. Now she had been bidden to accompany the old lady on a train tour of the Highlands. 'To revive old memories,' her grandmother had said, and had explained her plan more fully by letter.</p><p>'I hear that the train is splendidly equipped and very well staffed. I shall not need to exert myself, but of course I need a companion. You will come with me, Rosie.'</p><p>'Of course you must go,' her father had observed. 'It will be a pleasant holiday for you; besides, it will give Carrie a week of peace and quiet.' He hadn't seen his sister for some time but he had vivid memories of his mother keeping her under her thumb. A week of freedom would do her good. So all the arrangements had been made; Rosie was to travel up to Edinburgh by train, spend the night at her grandmother's house, and escort her to the station on the following day. There wouldn't be many passengers, she had been told, and she had been sent the brochure so that she would have some idea what to expect. It had looked rather fun, and they would see many of the places she had known so well as a child, only she thought it unlikely that she would have much chance to poke around on her own. Granny had made it quite clear that she expected constant attention and companionship.</p><p>She and her mother went downstairs presently into the kitchen, and began to get supper while they argued amicably as to whether Rosie's jersey suit would be better than her lovat corduroy skirt and country shirt with her matching gilet over.</p><p>'It could be quite chilly still,' argued Mrs Macdonald. 'On the other hand the jersey is useful. I wish you could have had some new clothes.'</p><p>'No need&#x2014;I've got several thin tops with me, and I'll take the skirt and gilet. There's the shirtwaister if it gets really warm.'</p><p>Her father came in presently, and she went to lay the table in the small dining-room, seldom used, but this evening seemed a special occasion.</p><p>Her father drove her to the station the next morning in the rather battered Land Rover. He hadn't much to say; he was a quiet man, tall and thin and hardworking; he looked after the estate with the same care with which he had run his own family home in Scotland. Rosie wished with all her heart that he and her mother could have been coming with her; more than that she wished that they could go back to her home there. She sat up straighter; it did no good to repine. It would be nice to see Granny again even though she was a tartar; she listened carefully to her father's last-minute messages, kissed him goodbye, and got into the train.</p><p>'I'll be back in a week,' she told him. 'I'll phone and let you know which train I'll be on.'</p><p>Her grandmother had sent enough money for her fare and for a taxi to get her to King's Cross Station, and she joined the long queue. She was seldom in London, she didn't like it much, and she was glad when she finally reached the station with time to spare for coffee before she needed to get on to the train. It was more than six years since she had been at King's Cross; that was when they had left Scotland, and Rosie remembered how unhappy she had been. Her spirits lifted at the thought of going back, even if only for a week, and she got on to the train, found a corner seat, and prepared to while away the journey with a paperback until the train had left London and its suburbs, and begun its race to the north.</p><p>Waverley Station hadn't changed; it was in the heart of Edinburgh, and she gave an unconscious sigh of pleasure as she went in search of a taxi. Her grandmother lived on the other side of Princes Street, in a grey granite house, tall and narrow, one of a terrace of such houses in a narrow, winding street near Queen Street Gardens, surprisingly quiet although there was the constant hum of traffic from Princes Street and Queen Street. She got out of the taxi, and stood for a moment on the pavement looking up at her grandmother's house. It hadn't changed at all; there was the same solid door, the same dark green curtains at the narrow windows. She mounted the steps to the door and banged the knocker, and after a few moments it was partly opened by Elspeth, the elderly maid who had been with her grandmother ever since Rosie could remember.</p><p>She must be all of seventy, thought Rosie, embracing her warmly, but she seemed ageless, her iron-grey hair scraped back into a stiff bun, her bony frame erect in its black dress.</p><p>Elspeth led the way into the narrow hall, and opened a door. 'Yer granny's waiting. I'll leave ye a wee while before I bring in the tea.'</p><p>She gave Rosie a little push and shut the door on her. Old Mrs Macdonald was sitting bolt upright in a high-backed chair. She was an imposing figure, tall and stout with dark hair only lightly streaked with silver. She was handsome, with dark eyes and a straight nose above an obstinate mouth. She hadn't changed, thought Rosie, crossing the room to kiss her.</p><p>'You had a good journey?' asked her grandmother, the question uttered in a voice which expected no reply. 'Your m...</p></p><h2>Spirit of the West/Sierra (Dreamworks)</h2><p>When a new stallion takes over her herd, Sierra, the adventurous daughter of the escaped saddle horse, Bonita, finds herself alone until she meets a stallion who brings her into a Native American camp.</p><p>Kathleen Duey is also the author of the fourth book in the Spirit of the Cimarron series, <i>Spirit: The Novel</i>.Grade 4-6-Sierra goes from wild horse to semi-tame in this story. She is accidentally separated from the rest of the horses, almost dies, but meets a young stallion that leads her to a Native American village. There a patient child accustoms her to humans and Sierra bears a foal, Rain. Each of the 12 chapters starts with Sierra's brief italicized reminiscences, followed by a third-person narration that fleshes them out. While there is much anthropomorphism, it is usually consistent with a horse's reality. However, the story line is only moderately compelling. Sierra's early life is rich with wild-horse behavior and herd interaction but the mare seems as much an observer as a participant. The other horses whose lives readers become involved with then disappear from the scene and children follow her almost reluctantly into her new life. The ending is not conclusive, but from reading about the DreamWorks film mentioned on the back cover (Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron), it is clear that Rain is a main character in the movie and that this story serves primarily to supply her background. With its handsome jacket illustration, it should attract horse lovers. Amy C. Laundrie's Whinny of the Wild Horses (Four Winds, 1990; o.p.) is a better story but movie fans will enjoy Sierra.<br><i>Louise L. Sherman, formerly at Anna C.

But not just because of its beautiful scenery, its rich traditions or historical heritage. I think it&#39;s the people-those wonderful individuals whose proclivities have labeled them a little the other side of center and who have added the spice to the life I enjoyed there for so many years. I hope the reader will enjoy some of my memories.&#39; With that, Betty Bauer turns us loose to ponder over why streakers never bothered to streak in Santa Fe, why one prominent publisher found solace in the lid of an ornate cigarette box, and how Santa Feans solve the problem of trees standing in the way of building sites. Did you know that one restaurant owner attracted customers by having a full-grown bobcat prowl the premises? Or that Santa Feans still have a yearly celebration that started in 1712 and includes the burning of a thirty-foot dummy? What about the &#39;five nuts in adobe huts&#39;? Not to mention the mysterious and color-coded worshipers of St. Germain, or what happened when a zealous cop insisted a local landscaper&#39;s station wagon was filled with marijuana plants. One man even had a dream of building a major opera house just outside of town! It&#39;s all here-fifty years spent in soaking up everything that truly makes Santa Fe &#39;The City Different.&#39;</p><p>Betty E. Bauer arrived in Santa Fe in 1948 and lived there from 1953 to 2000. She and her partner, Marian F. Love, founded and published The Santa Fean Magazine from 1972 to 1994. She was very active in civic, municipal and cultural pursuits, having served as the first woman President of the Santa Fe Press Club (now defunct), the first woman President (now Chairman of the Board) of the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce, and President of the Santa Fe Festival of the Arts, as well as on numerous civic and municipal committees. She now lives in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p><h2>Tommy Robinson Enemy of the State</h2><p>Both harrowing and at times hilarious, this is the story of the persecution of a British patriot, by his own government and the judicial system. Just an ordinary Luton man, Stephen Lennon &#39;became&#39; Tommy Robinson after his attempts to highlight the dangers of radical Islam led to him being labelled a far right extremist and subjected to years of harassment, arrests and even attempts on his life. And when all else failed, Britain&#39;s security services tried to blackmail into working for them. At times barely believable, this is the true story of how ordinary British men and women are seen as the enemy by their own police and politicians.</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide to Knitting and Crocheting Illustrated, 3rdEdition</h2><p><b>Now with gorgeous color photos!</b> <p>Updated and completely revised, this guide has been a bestseller ever since its first publication.

She won multiple awards for her writing, including the <i>Romantic Times</i> Best New Historical Author award.Juliet White has only one living relative left, the child that her now deceased sister bore six years past. Juliet is an indentured servant and chooses to sell several more years of her life to her master if he will allow her to go to Scotland to look for the child. Juliet's search takes her to the home of Lachlan MacKenzie, The Duke of Ross whom she comes to believe is the child's father. However there is one problem. Actually four...four girls who are as different as any siblings could be, except for their ages. They are all six years old. Lachlan MacKenzie loves his daughters and protects them with a fierceness no one dare cross. Each having a different mother, Lachlan must protect their mothers' identities, else they could come to harm. Politics lay at the heart of the matter, and if the history of the children becomes known, many could suffer. When Juliet obtains the position of governess to the children, her secret efforts to discover their mothers' identities is as fierce as Lachlan's determination to keep the girls' past hidden. Trust must be earned on both sides before the two can allow themselves to give in to the feelings each stirs in the other. Regardless of their suspicions and distrust, Lachlan and Juliet are drawn to each other and can no longer deny their feelings. Each of the girls has claimed Juliet's heart and once she realizes that it doesn't matter which is her blood relative, as she loves them all, an enemy from Lachlan's past becomes curious about the girls and may put them all, and Lachlan's people, in grave danger.

A former schoolteacher and mother of three boys, Craft doesn&#39;t experience ordinary everyday happenings like most. In her vivid world, nothing is simple and everything appears pertinent. Even an average trip to the grocery store is a feat and cause for reflection. From being a dyslexic cheerleader with dysgraphia going the wrong direction, to bathroom stalking, to figuring out if she can wear that panty-free dress, Craft explores the profoundness of daily living through hilarious anecdotes and heartwarming childhood memories. When she&#39;s not laughing at the bizarreness of her days or reflecting back, then she&#39;s sharing the serious and relevant challenges of everyday living on the autism spectrum. Ten years in the making, Craft&#39;s revealing memoir brings Asperger&#39;s Syndrome into a spectrum of brilliant light-exposing the day-to-day interactions and complex inner workings of an autistic female from childhood to midlife.</p><p>There has never been another book like Everyday Aspergers. In prose that is alternatingly playful, witty, brave, heartbreaking, and encouraging, Samantha Craft explores her experience of life on the spectrum in meticulous and comprehensive detail. Many parts of the book &#x2014; including &#x201c;116 Reasons I Know I Have Asperger&#x2019;s Syndrome&#x201d; and her description of her journey to &#x201c;Planet Aspie&#x201d; and return to Earth &#x2014; are classic, stand-alone set pieces that rank with the very best writing from autistic self-advocates. This book is a gift for autistic people in general, for autistic women in specific, and for neurotypical readers who want to become more effective allies. By exploring her autism, Craft teaches us all how to be more compassionate and alive human beings.&#x201d; ~ Steve Silberman, author of NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity<br><br>Spectrum &#x201c;This book is stunning, beautifully written with a raw and arresting honesty that illuminates the details of living and being autistic/Aspie.

This is one book that I&#x2019;ll be recommending in my &#x201c;what next&#x201d; sections with my clients. Everyday Aspergers will no doubt serve as a helpful resource to many.&#x201d; ~ Tania Marshall, M.Sc., psychologist and gold winning author of I am Aspien Woman and I Am AspienGirl <br><br>&#x201c;Everyday Aspergers is easy to read, accessible and incredibly relatable. As an Autistic woman myself, I found countless points of commonality with Craft&#x2019;s experiences and thoughts about life. The book is passionate&#x2014;a great work of advocacy, as well as an honest and heartfelt personal account of the author&#x2019;s life. The book presents a life lived with challenges but also with great strengths and quiet wisdom. Craft shatters a number of myths around things like Autism and empathy, creativity and love. It was moving and meaningful on many levels. If you are on the Autism spectrum yourself or know, love or care for someone who is, I strongly recommend this book.

To its contemporary readers, it also offered the thrill of uncovering blackmail and criminal violence within the homes of the upper class.

Their mission: rescue 100 hostages from a terrorist stronghold-- alive.<br><br>With realism seldom seen in military fiction, <i>The Med</i> is a magnificent and timely epic that brings the human drama of armed conflict compellingly to life. Driven by believable, flesh-and-blood characters, it is a painstakingly detailed portrait of amphibious warfare as only David Poyer can paint it. <i>The Med</i> is today's most explosive tale of international crisis, personal valor, and emotional struggle-- a disturbingly plausible novel that crackles with non-stop action.<br></p><p>David Poyer's naval career has included service in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, Arctic, Caribbean, and Pacific. His seventeen novels have won millions of readers around the world, and his sea fiction is required reading in the Literature of the Sea course at the U.S. Naval Academy. <i>The Med</i> is the first in his novel-cycle of the modern Navy, which also includes <i>The Gulf</i>, <i>The Circle</i>, <i>The Passage</i> and<i> Tomahawk</i>. He lives in Virginia with his wife and daughter.<br>In the mold of such novels as From Here to Eternity and the recent Time and Tide, this is a powerful story, as honest as it is imaginative, about a joint Navy-Marine task force on a mission to rescue a large group of American and British hostages being held in Syria by Palestinian terrorists. The plot revolves around a few key characters, each in the grip of crises both personal and relevant to the fate of the mission. Among the well-delineated principals are the force commander, a jittery, careerist commodore unworthy of his rank; a naval lieutenant trying to live down a tragic past mistake; a chief engineer who figures in a wonderfully vivid engine-room drama; a sensitive, guitar-playing black who feels out of place in the Marines; the lieutenant's wife, who is among the hostages; and the terrorist leader, ruthless yet with a certain charisma. The commodore's inadequacies jeopardize the Marine assault that is the story's exciting climax. Readers will be gripped by the impression that these are real men in a realistic, and indeed uncomfortably topical, situation. Poyer is a former Navy officer. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tactical Tracking Operations</h2><p>This manual is packed with practical lessons, on-the-ground tricks, training drills and equipment suggestions for the solo tracker on up to a multiagency tracking operation. Learn from a 30-year veteran how to find and follow tracks through any terrain; assess the age of tracks; relocate the trail after it&#39;s gone missing; foil every effort to throw off your pursuit; coordinate a four-man team while tracking armed fugitives; set up and run large tracking operations, use the latest high-tech gear to find fugitives and more.</p><p>David Scott-Donelan was a career soldier spanning almost three decades of active duty in the war zones of Rhodesia, South Africa, Mozambique, and South-West Africa/Namibia. <p>Enlisting in the Army of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1961, Scott-Donelan was one of the original members of the resuscitated C Squadron (Rhodesia) Special Air Service, where he was introduced to the concepts of irregular warfare and tactical tracking by Allan Savory, a game ranger known for his innovative and successful concepts in hunting down heavily armed elephant and rhino poachers. </p><p>In 1968 Scott-Donelan was posted to the new Tracker Combat Unit (TCU), commanded by Allan Savory, with the mission of tracking down and annihilating Communist-trained and equipped nationalist insurgents infiltrating the Rhodesian border from Zambia and Mozambique. He went on to command the TCU and was responsible for the selection and training of expert trackers for the unit, which was beginning to make a name for itself on operations. In 1974b the TCU was absorbed by an innovative new counterinsurgency unit known as the Selous Scouts, and Scott-Donelan was posted to the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), which was heavily involved in helicopter and airborne operations against armed terrorist gangs infiltrating Rhodesia in increasing numbers. After several years of nonstop action in the RLI, he served as an intelligence officer at a Brigade HQ and Combined Operations HQ, Rhodesia's equivalent of the Pentagon. Frustrated with staff duties, he agitated for a transfer to the Selous Scouts and was appointed Officer Commanding Training Group, which included the Tracking and Bush Survival School, the notorious "Wafa Wafa, " on the shores of Lake Kariba. </p><p>In 1980, due to intense political pressure from the United States, Britain and the United Nations, Rhodesia, after having never lost a battle, lost the war and became the Republic of Zimbabwe. </p><p>Joining the South African Special Forces in 1980 as a member of 5 Reconnaissance Regiment, he commanded the regiment's Developmental Wing, which was responsible for establishing a complete training and operational resource base as well as conducting training programs for several guerrilla armies. Five years later he was seconded to the South-West Africa Territorial Force as a company commander and made responsible for operations against the Peoples Liberation Army of Namibia infiltrating into South- West Africa/Namibia from Angola and Zambia. </p><p>Immigrating to the United States in 1989, he is now the training director of the Tactical Tracking Operations School, which trains law enforcement, corrections, and military personnel in the same tracking techniques that proved so successful against armed and dangerous fugitives in Africa.</p></p><h2>The Life of Adam Clarke</h2><p>The biography of the great theologian Adam Clarke. Clarke was a prolific writer of theology and the author of the definitive Commentary on the Old and New Testaments of the Holy Bible, inarguably the most comprehensive study of the Scriptures ever produced. Written by Samuel Dunn, a contemporary of Adam Clarke and his prot�g�, this biography explores Clarke&#39;s early life, conversion, education, adulthood as a theologian and his death. Great study of a great man of God.</p><p></p><h2>Just One Catch: A Biography of Joseph Heller</h2><p><p><b>The<i> New York Times</i> bestselling writer Tracy Daugherty illuminates his most vital subject yet in this first biography of the <i>Catch-22</i> author Joseph Heller</b></p><p>Joseph Heller was a Coney Island kid, the son of Russian immigrants, who went on to great fame and fortune. His most memorable novel took its inspiration from a mission he flew over France in WWII (his plane was filled with so much shrapnel it was a wonder it stayed in the air). Heller wrote seven novels, all of which remain in print. <i>Something Happened </i>and <i>Good as Gold, </i>to name two, are still considered the epitome of satire. His life was filled with women and romantic indiscretions, but he was perhaps more famous for his friendships&#x2015;he counted Mel Brooks, Zero Mostel, Carl Reiner, Kurt Vonnegut, Norman Mailer, Mario Puzo, Dustin Hoffman, and many others among his confidantes. In 1981 Heller was diagnosed with Guillain-Barr� Syndrome, a debilitating syndrome that could have cost him his life. Miraculously, he recovered. When he passed away in 1999 from natural causes, he left behind a body of work that continues to sell hundreds of thousands of copies a year. </p><p><i>Just One Catch </i>is the first biography of Yossarian's creator.</p></p><p><b>Tracy Daugherty</b> is the author of several novels and short story collections, and a book of personal essays. His critically acclaimed biography of Donald Barthelme, <i>Hiding Man</i> was published in 2009. He has received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. Currently, he is Distinguished Professor of English and Creative Writing at Oregon State University.</p><h2>Poetic Justice (Kate Fansler)</h2><p>Student riots have ravaged the distinguished New York City university where Kate Fansler teaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ensuing disarray, the survival of the university's plebeian stepchild, University College, seems doubtful. President Jeremiah Cudlipp is snobbishly determined to ax it; and as sycophantic professors fall in line behind him, the rally of Kate and few rebellious colleagues seems doomed. It is a fight to the death, and only a miracle--or perhaps a murder--can save their beloved institution. . . .</p><p>Amanda Cross is the pseudonymous author of the bestselling Kate Fansler mysteries. As Carolyn G. Heilbrun, she is the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities Emerita at Columbia University. She has served as president of the Modern Language Association as well as vice president of the Authors Guild.

There<br>was not a great deal to be said for revolutions--not, at any rate, in<br>Kate's opinion--but they did accustom one to boredom in the face of<br>extraordinary events, and a pleasant sense of breathless surprise at the<br>calm occurrence of the expected. Kate said as much to Professor Castleman<br>as they waited for the elevator in Lowell Hall.<br><br>"Well," he answered, "I might have found myself even more overcome with<br>amazement if they had not managed to put my course in historical methods,<br>which never has less than a hundred and fifty students, into a classroom<br>designed to hold ninety only if the students sit two in a chair, which,<br>these days, they probably prefer to do. Though come to think of it," he<br>added as the elevator, empty, went heedlessly past, apparently on some<br>mysterious mission of its own, "I don't know why students should expect<br>seats at lectures, since audiences can no longer expect them at the<br>theater. We went to a play last night--I use the word 'play,' you<br>understand, to describe what we expected to see, not what we saw--and not<br>only were there no seats, the entertainment principally consisted of the<br>members of the cast removing their clothes and urging, gently of course,<br>that the audience do likewise. My wife and I, fully clothed, felt rather<br>like missionaries to Africa insufficiently indoctrinated into the antics<br>of the aborigines. Shall we walk down? One thing at least has not changed<br>in this university: the elevators. They have never worked, they do not now<br>work, and though an historian should never speak with assurance of the<br>future, I am willing to wager that they never will. Where are you off to?<br>Don't tell me, I know. A meeting. What's more, I can tell you what you are<br>going to discuss: relevance."<br><br>"That," said Kate, "would be the expected. As a matter of fact, I have a<br>doctoral examination: the poetry of W. H. Auden. He wrote a good bit of<br>clever poetry to your muse."<br><br>"Mine? Gracious, have I got a muse? Just what I've needed all these years.<br>Do you think I could trade her in for a cleaning woman, three days a week<br>with only occasional ironing? My wife would be prostrate with gratitude."<br><br>"Trade Clio in? Impossible. It is she into whose eyes 'we look for<br>recognition after we have been found out.' "<br><br>"Did Auden write that? Obviously he's never been married. That's a<br>description of any wife. I thought you were in the Victorian period."<br><br>"I am, I am. Auden was born in 1907. He only missed Victoria by six years.<br>And don't be so frivolous about Clio. Auden called her 'Madonna of<br>silences, to whom we turn When we have lost control.' "<br><br>"Well, get hold of her," Professor Castleman said. "I'm ready to turn."<br>The dissertation examination was not, in fact, scheduled for another hour.<br>Kate wandered back toward her office, not hurrying, because no sooner<br>would she reach Baldwin Hall, in which building dwelt the Graduate English<br>Department, than she would be immediately accosted, put on five more<br>committees, asked to examine some aspect of the curriculum about which she<br>knew nothing (like the language requirement for medieval studies) and to<br>settle the problems of endlessly waiting students concerning, likely as<br>not, questions not only of poetry and political polarization, but of pot<br>and the<br>pill as well. Kate strolled along in the sort of trance to which she had<br>by now grown accustomed. It was the result of fatigue, mental indigestion,<br>a sense of insecurity which resembled being tossed constantly in a blanket<br>as<br>much as it resembled anything, and, strangest of all, a love for the<br>University which was as irrational as it was unrewarded.<br><br>She would have been hard put to say, she thought looking about her, what<br>it was she loved. Certainly not the administration (had there been one,<br>which, since they had resigned one by one like the ten little Indians,<br>there wasn't). Not the Board of Governors, a body of tired,<br>ultraconservative businessmen who could not understand why a university<br>should not be run like a business or a country club. The students, the<br>faculty, the place? It was inexplicable. The love one shares with a city<br>is often a secret love, Camus had said; the love for a university was<br>apparently no less so.<br><br>"Kate Fansler!" a voice said. "How very, very nice. 'I must telephone<br>Kate,' I have said to Winthrop again and again, 'we must have lunch, we<br>must have dinner, we must meet.' And now, you see, we have."<br><br>Kate paused on the steps of Baldwin Hall and smiled at the sight of Polly<br>Spence. Talk of the unexpected! Polly Spence belonged to the world of<br>Kate's family--she had actually been, years ago, a protegee of Kate's<br>mother's--and there emanated from her the aura of St. Bernard's--where her<br>sons had gone to school--and Milton Academy, the Knickerbocker dancing<br>classes and cotillions.<br><br>"I know," Polly Spence said, "my instincts tell me that if I wait here<br>patiently you will say something, perhaps even something profound, like<br>'Hello.' "<br><br>"It's good to see you, Polly," Kate said. "I don't know what's become of<br>me. I feel like the heroine of that Beckett play who is buried up to her<br>neck and spends every waking moment rummaging around in a large,<br>unorganized handbag. Come to see the action, as the young say?"<br><br>"Action? Profanity, more likely. Four-letter-word-bathroom,<br>four-letter-word-sex, and really too tiresome, when I think that my own<br>two poor lambs were positively glared at if they said 'damn.' It's not an<br>easy world to keep up with."<br><br>"But if I know you, you're keeping up all the same."<br><br>"Of course I am. I'm taking a doctorate. In fact, I've almost got it. Now<br>what do you think of that? I'm writing a dissertation for the Linguistics<br>Department on the history of Verner's Law. Please look impressed. The<br>Linguistics Department is overjoyed, because the darlings didn't know<br>there was anything new to say about Verner's Law until I told them, and<br>they've been taking it like perfect angels."<br><br>Kate smiled. "I always suspected an extraordinary brain operating behind<br>all your committee-woman talents, but whatever made you decide to get a<br>Ph.D.?"<br><br>"Grandchildren," Polly said. "Three chuckling little boys, one gurgling<br>little girl, all under three. It was either hours and hours of<br>baby-sitting, to say nothing of having the little darlings cavalierly<br>dumped upon us at the slightest excuse, or I had to get a job that would<br>be absolutely respected. Winthrop has encouraged me. 'Polly,' he said, 'if<br>we are not to find ourselves changing diapers every blessed weekend, you<br>had better find something demanding to say you're doing.' The children, of<br>course, are furious, but I am now a teaching<br>assistant, very, very busy, thank you, and only condescending to rally<br>round at Christmas and Easter. Summers I dash off to do research and<br>Winthrop joins me when he can. But you look tired, and here I am chatting<br>away. Let's have lunch one day at the Cosmopolitan Club."<br><br>"I'm not a member."<br><br>"Of course not, dear, though I never understood why. Why are you looking<br>so tired?"<br><br>"Meetings. Meetings and meetings. We are all trying, as you must have<br>heard, to restructure the University, another way of saying that we, like<br>the chap in the animated cartoons, have looked down to discover we are not<br>standing on anything. Then, of course, we fall."<br><br>"But everybody's resigned. The President. The Vice-President. We've got an<br>Acting President, we're getting a Faculty Senate, surely everything's<br>looking up."<br><br>"Perhaps. But the English Department has discovered there is no real<br>reason for most of the things they have been happily doing for years. And<br>the teaching<br>assistants--where, by the way, are you being a teaching assistant? Don't<br>tell me the College has reformed itself sufficiently to be hiring female,<br>no-longer-young ladies, however talented . . ."<br><br>"Not them; not bloody likely. I'm at the University College. Very<br>exciting. Really, Kate, you have no idea."<br><br>Kate, looking blank, realized she hadn't.<br><br>"Really," Polly Spence said, "the snobbery of you people in the graduate<br>school! We're doing splendid work over there . . ."<br><br>"Didn't the University College used to be the extension school? Odd<br>courses for people at loose ends like members of labor unions who only<br>work twenty hours a week and housewives whose children are . . . ?"<br><br>"That was a hundred years ago. There are no more courses in<br>basket-weaving. We give a degree, we have a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, and<br>our students are very intelligent people who simply don't want to play<br>football or have a posture picture taken."</p><h2>Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped</h2><p><b>The stunning story of Russia's slide back into a dictatorship&#x2014;and how the West is now paying the price for allowing it to happen.</b><br><br>The ascension of Vladimir Putin&#x2014;a former lieutenant colonel of the KGB&#x2014;to the presidency of Russia in 1999 was a strong signal that the country was headed away from democracy. Yet in the intervening years&#x2014;as America and the world's other leading powers have continued to appease him&#x2014;Putin has grown not only into a dictator but an internationalthreat. With his vast resources and nuclear arsenal, Putin is at the center of a worldwide assault on political liberty and the modern world order.<br><br>For Garry Kasparov, none of this is news. He has been a vocal critic of Putin for over a decade, even leading the pro-democracy opposition to him in the farcical 2008 presidential election. Yet years of seeing his Cassandra-like prophecies about Putin's intentions fulfilled have left Kasparov with a darker truth: Putin's Russia, like ISIS or Al Qaeda, defines itself in opposition to the free countries of the world.<br><br>As Putin has grown ever more powerful, the threat he poses has grown from local to regional and finally to global. In this urgent book, Kasparov shows that the collapse of the Soviet Union was not an endpoint&#x2014;only a change of seasons, as the Cold War melted into a new spring. But now, after years of complacency and poor judgment, winter is once again upon us.<br><br>Argued with the force of Kasparov's world-class intelligence, conviction, and hopes for his home country, <i>Winter Is Coming</i> reveals Putin for what he is: an existential danger hiding in plain sight.</p><p><b>Garry Kasparov</b> spent twenty years as the world's number one ranked chess player. In 2005, he retired from professional chess to lead the pro-democracy opposition against Vladimir Putin, from street protests to coalition building. In 2012, he was named chairman of the Human Rights Foundation, succeeding V�clav Havel. He has been a contributing editor to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> since 1991 and he is a senior visiting fellow at the Oxford Martin School. His 2007 book, <i>How Life Imitates Chess</i>, has been published in twenty-six languages. He lives in self-imposed exile in New York with his wife Dasha and their children."A compelling story of courage and civic-mindedness...With his wealth and status, [Kasparov] could easily have opted to live out life like a Russian oligarch, buying baubles and yachting from port to port. Instead, he plunged into politics, organizing coalitions to challenge the autocratic rule of Vladimir Putin, taking a leading role in public demonstrations and marches, and in 2007 running for president himself...<i>Winter Is Coming</i> presents a picture of the internal forces propelling Russia's descent into aggressive authoritarianism. And it offers a scathing analysis of the contribution of the West to that outcome." --<i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"Brave, trenchant and convincing... The book gallops through the collapse of the Soviet Union and the chaotic 1990s and then charges full tilt at Vladimir Putin: a former KGB man who is a far more dangerous adversary than most outsiders realise. His rise to power in 1999 should have been a deafening alarm call to the West: as shocking as an ex-Gestapo officer coming to power in Germany... Western politicians who offer grand visions and bold leadership, such as Senator John McCain, don't get elected. Voters in democratic countries tend to prefer low key leaders and a quiet life to blood, sweat, toil and tears. How does one defend a free world that does not want to defend itself? Let us hope that Kasparov's book becomes a bestseller." --<i>The Sunday Times</i><i> (UK)</i><br><br>"His prose, like his chess, is fast, ferocious and unforgiving... vividly describes the growing authoritarianism of Mr. Putin's regime, culminating in the February murder of Boris Nemtsov, the opposition leader... The real power of Kasparov's book lies in his argument that the west must pursue a more assertive and moral foreign policy, something that has faded out of fashion." --<i>Financial Times</i><br><br>"It's always important to read Garry Kasparov, who warned the dangers of Putinism long before so many others. He is that rare thing: A Russian democrat who is realistic about his country, but remains hopeful for the future." --Anne Applebaum, author of <i>Gulag</i> and <i>Iron Curtain</i>, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction<br><br>"Garry Kasparov has the information-processing capacity of a supercomputer and the eloquence of an extraordinary orator. It takes a mind and a heart like his to analyze the last 25 years of the history of Russia in the world and emerge with not only an indictment of Western complicity but a clear call for Western action. Required reading for anyone planning to run in, work on, or vote in the 2016 presidential campaign." --Masha Gessen, author of <i>The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin</i> and <i>Words Will Break Cement: The Passion of Pussy Riot</i><br><br>"Garry Kasparov has written a passionate indictment both of Russia's kleptocracy and the complacency of Western democracies in the face of Putin. This threat has become our central foreign policy challenge, and Kasparov's arguments are essential in understanding how to face it." --Francis Fukuyama, Stanford University<br><br>"Lively and readable...Throughout <i>Winter Is Coming</i>, Kasparov keeps the narration brisk and generously includes flashes of humor...If you know nothing about post-Soviet Russia, this is a good place to start. And if you're a longtime Russia watcher like me, you should read this book and steel yourself for the inevitable sadness and sense of loss as Kasparov details how quickly Russia's chance for democracy after the Cold War ended was snuffed out. Kasparov is a witty and engaging companion throughout the book. But make no mistake-he is walking with you through a cold, fading dusk that, in the end, promises only a long night of a Russian winter." --<i>The Federalist</i><br><br>"If you're looking for a way to understand what Putin is about, this book may be for you... Kasparov has written a passionate, detailed warning to wake up the West." --<i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i><br><br>"An emotionally charged look at Russia since the fall of Communism centred on the rise and rule of Vladimir Putin...A fascinating and thought-provoking book." --<i>Irish Independent</i></p><h2>The Art Of Desire (Arabesque)</h2><p>The Art Of Desire by Selena Montgomery released on Dec 25, 2001 is available now for purchase.</p><p>Ms. Montgomery takes reader[s] on an exciting ride of emotions and passion, [w]ith the style and finesse of a veteran. -- <i>Romance In Color, May 2001 (reviewing Rules of Engagement)</i></p><h2>Virginia Woolf, Life and London: A Biography of Place</h2><p>The author delineates Virginia Woolf&#39;s intense personal and literary response to London, arguing that London was the symbol of the &#34;life&#34; that she failed to find in the novels of her youth and that she struggled to put back into fiction</p><p></p><h2>Cervantes.

An award-winning writer with twenty years of experience, she lives in North Carolina.Holmstedt started studying the experience of women marines when she lived near Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Her research became a master&#39;s thesis in creative writing and the most up-to-date discussion of women in the current war. Unblushingly in favor of women in combat, she doesn&#39;t whitewash their experiences or exaggerate their achievements. Their male colleagues aren&#39;t universally accepting, but many of them admit that the women are performing effectively; since 20 percent of the troops currently in Iraq are women, they must. Following the tradition of American soldiers before them, they say that they are &#34;just doing the job.&#34; That is, they are flying F-18s into enemy ground fire, driving Hummers and trucks that may be ambushed at any moment, and playing invaluable roles in intelligence operations and in the nation building that is one of the more positive aspects of a seemingly interminable and frustrating conflict. Nearly 500 female soldiers have been killed or wounded in Iraq. Invaluable as well as readable. Green, Roland</p><h2>The Mother at Home</h2><p>Long esteemed as one of the most valued works from the 19th century on the art of mothering and the glory of the work of the mother at home, The Mother at Home is valuable reading for any girl or young women desiring instruction on proper discipline of her own children. Rarely in print and worth obtaining at any price, The Mother at Home is a superb guide for Christian mothers who want biblical counsel on Christian child rearing. The object of this valuable book is practical utility, as opposed to literary effect. Written in 1833 for mothers in the common walks of life, it tunes into the realities and seriousness of child rearing. John Abbott s eloquent and powerful illustrations provoke a parent to focus on the child&#39;s soul; not just their mind (i.e. education) or body (i.e. health). Abbott clearly understood that the child will one day grow up; and how he or she is raised now will affect the end result (Proverbs 22:6). Couples who read this book together will achieve more unity in parenting, plus a better understanding of what needs to be done for children. One of the most helpful, to the point, books ever written outside of the Bible, The Mother at Home is recommended to all parents with children.</p><p>John Stevens Cabot Abbott (September 19, 1805 June 17, 1877), an American historian, pastor, and pedagogical writer, was born in Brunswick, Maine to Jacob and Betsey Abbott. He was a brother of Jacob Abbott, and was associated with him in the management of Abbott&#39;s Institute, New York City, and in the preparation of his series of brief historical biographies. Dr. Abbott graduated at Bowdoin College in 1825, prepared for the ministry at Andover Theological Seminary, and between 1830 and 1844, when he retired from the ministry in the Congregational Church, preached successively at Worcester, Roxbury and Nantucket, all in Massachusetts. Owing to the success of a little work, The Mother at Home, he devoted himself, from 1844 onwards, to literature. He was a voluminous writer of books on Christian ethics, and of popular histories, which were credited with cultivating a popular interest in history. He is best known as the author of the widely popular History of Napoleon Bonaparte (1855), in which the various elements and episodes in Napoleon&#39;s career are described. Abbott takes a very favourable view towards his subject throughout. Also among his principal works are: History of the Civil War in America (1863-1866), and The History of Frederick II, Called Frederick the Great (New York, 1871). In general, except that he did not write juvenile fiction, his work in subject and style closely resembles that of his brother, Jacob Abbott.</p><h2>Puffin By Design: 70 Years Of Imagination 1940-2010</h2><p>Late in 1939 a chance meeting between Penguin founder, Allen Lane, and natural history publisher, Noel Carrington, changed the future of children&#39;s publishing with the formation of a series called Puffin Picture Books. The first four titles appeared in 1940 and the series quickly established a reputation for presenting children&#39;s non-fiction in a unique blend of editing and design. Puffin Story Books soon followed with the publication of Worzel Gummidge in 1941 and, like the original launch of Penguin itself, these story books appeared in the three horizontal stripe design. Looking back at seventy years of Puffin paperbacks, Phil Baines charts the development of Puffin and the role of illustrators and designers in creating and defining the identity of the Puffin list from the very first picture book through to modern day. Rich with stunning cover and inside illustrations, and filled with detail of individual titles, Phil discusses the changes in typography, illustration and printing techniques over Puffin&#39;s spectacular 70-year history.

We have entered a period of great expansion of medical knowledge and competition between different schools of thought and practice. Many voices clamor for an audience. Some of us sit in our private practices hoping to educate our friends and neighbors about our way of practicing. Some of us seek to popularize one school or another. Others of us seek to be seen as experts by our colleagues within our school or our colleagues from other schools. Within this great colliding of egos, ideas and individual realities, there is a promising current. As the predominant medical model of our time and place seems to be suffering the fate of fragmentation inherent in its core ideology, many are asking important questions. What will become of our current model? What new model will arise? Will we have clashing paradigms forever, will one or another win out, or will there be a merging? In his new book, Biomedicine: A Textbook for Practitioners of Acupuncture &amp; Oriental Medicine, Dr. Bruce Robinson dives into this melee. This book is really two books in one. It is a simple textbook meant to introduce the ideas and practice of biomedicine to acupuncturists. It does this admirably with a clear, easily accessible layout, a great deal of useful information and a gentle touch. It also is a rap session about the current state of medicine in this country. As such it is infused with philosophy, social observation and critique, a personal, thoughtful voice and an occasional touch of humor. As a textbook this is a wonderful source of information. It is divided into sections based on categories of disease. Each section has a few chapters of introduction that clearly lay the groundwork needed to understand specific diseases discussed in that section. The introductory chapters are followed by descriptions of individual diseases. These descriptions include signs and s --By Elliott Freed, L.Ac.

Laughlin proposes nothing less than a new way of understanding fundamental laws of science. In this age of superstring theories and Big-Bang cosmology, we&#39;re used to thinking of the unknown as being impossibly distant from our everyday lives. The edges of science, we&#39;re told, lie in the first nanofraction of a second of the Universe&#39;s existence, or else in realms so small that they can&#39;t be glimpsed even by the most sophisticated experimental techniques. But we haven&#39;t reached the end of science, Laughlin argues-only the end of reductionist thinking. If we consider the world of emergent properties instead, suddenly the deepest mysteries are as close as the nearest ice cube or grain of salt. And he goes farther: the most fundamental laws of physics-such as Newton&#39;s laws of motion and quantum mechanics -are in fact emergent. They are properties of large assemblages of matter, and when their exactness is examined too closely, it vanishes into nothing.A Different Universe takes us into a universe where the vacuum of space has to be considered a kind of solid matter, where sound has quantized particles just like those of light, where there are many phases of matter, not just three, and where metal resembles a liquid while superfluid helium is more like a solid. It is a universe teeming with natural phenomena still to be discovered. This is a truly mind-altering book that shows readers a surprising, exquisitely beautiful and mysterious new world.</p><p><b>Robert Laughlin</b> is the Robert M. and Anne Bass Professor of Physics at Stanford University, where he has taught since 1985. In 1998 he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the fractional quantum Hall effect. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He lives in Palo Alto, California.In the search for a "theory of everything," scientists scrutinize ever-smaller components of the universe. String theory postulates units so minuscule that researchers won't have the technology to detect them for decades. Stanford physics professor Laughlin, awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize for Physics, argues that smaller is not necessarily better. He proposes turning our attention instead to emerging properties of large agglomerations of matter. For instance, chaos theory has been all the rage of late with its speculations about the "butterfly effect," but understanding how individual streams of air combine to form a tornado is almost impossible. It's easier and more efficient, says Laughlin, to study the tornado. Laws and theories follow from collective behavior, not the other way around, and if we try to analyze things too closely, we risk not understanding how they work on a macro level. In many cases, the whole exhibits properties that can't be explained by the behavior of its parts. As Laughlin points out, we use computers and internal combustion engines every day, but scientists don't totally understand why all of their parts work the way they do. Many interesting and challenging observations make this book worthwhile reading, but Laughlin doesn't bring his own parts together to form a coherent whole. Yet many science buffs and young scientists will find this a worthwhile challenge to business as usual in physics.

He's an etymologist with a sense of humor, a lexicographer with an attitude. Morris's unique approach to language and his distinctive brand of absurdity have found a loyal following of readers curious about everything from soup to nuts--and that means the origins of the phrase soup to nuts, and thousands more words and phrases. This book is a collection of 150 of Morris's language columns, which appear in newspapers throughout the country and on his popular Web site. <p> A clueless husband writes the WORD DETECTIVE to ask if his wife has insulted him by calling him gormless.

Evan Morris, whose Web site and syndicated column solve more mysteries than even Scotland Yard could manage, has assembled a book of entertaining questions and answers that will amuse, educate, and resolve arguments all at once. From "amok" to "zarf", the definitions and origins of words are explained with a delightful combination of wit and research that will leave curious readers delighted.<p> Each entry begins with the original question asked of Morris, complete with the writer's misspellings and misinformation, and a few of these may result in cringes from the serious wordsmiths out there. One query incorrectly remembers the metaphor "hair of the dog that bit you" as "Something like <i>bite the dog's tail</i> or <i>the dog that bit you last night</i>," and Morris makes plenty of entertaining suggestions regarding these incorrect versions before finally explaining that the phrase have been around since about 1546, and specifically refers to a hangover remedy. The author is in especially fine form while explaining the phrase "passing the bar"--who knew that it dates back to a requirement that lawyers wrestle a grizzly "bar" before entering into practice? The correct explanation follows Morris's whimsical tale, but 16th-century England just doesn't have quite the same entertainment value. Several special sections cover larger topics, such as food- and animal-based phrases (easy as pie, dog days), onomatopoeia, euphemisms, diner slang, and Yiddish expressions. While not as detailed as the alphabetical entries, words like "wreck", "mensch," and "throb" are given satisfying, if short, descriptions. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>Comic, skeptic, cyber-sleuth, syndicated columnist, and inspired wordsmith, Evan Morris is the Word Detective.

Annie Lineberger was so far out his league that he felt like she was playing an entirely different game, but somehow he won her affections. He couldn't believe his good luck while it lasted. They both were 18, but Grayson was a baby, and Annie had been around. She was beautiful, smart and funny. When she told him she loved him, he would have died for her, right then and there.<br><br>Instead, Annie died or at least disappeared from the face of the earth. On the same night when she broke Grayson's teenage heart by giving him his walking papers, she vanished.<br><br>Everyone believed he killed her. Without a body, though, nothing could be proved. And so Grayson Melvin lived his life. Kicked out of his university, he went from the Army and Vietnam to bartending to another college to newspapers, where he discovered that Annie s well-connected and vengeful family still had the power to step into his stunted life and punish him.<br><br>Then, in the spring of 2016, Annie reappears. Our at least her bones do, dug up by a backhoe operator clearing land for a strip mall in a small Virginia town. Grayson, now teaching at a community college in Richmond and creeping toward retirement, is back in a spotlight he has tried to avoid for all his adult life.<br><br>With the court of public opinion almost unanimously against him, Grayson goes back to North Carolina to try to make the past go away, with disastrous results. Then, he gets a call. A woman he doesn't know in a town where he's never been has found a ring his high school ring last seen in Annie Lineberger's possession. Grayson Melvin has one chance to prove his innocence, by chasing a ghost and figuring out what happened on that long-ago night, the one when he lost Annie.</p><p>This is HOWARD OWEN'S 16th novel. Owen was a longtime newspaperman, working at everything from reporter to sports editor to editorial pages editor. He has been writing fiction since 1989. He and his wife, Karen, live in Richmond. Among his earlier novels are the best-selling <i>Littlejohn</i> and the Willie Black mystery, <i>Oregon Hill</i>, which won the Dashiell Hammett prize for best crime literature in the United States and Canada.In 1968, Grayson Melvin, the protagonist of this moving, well-crafted standalone from Owen (<i>The Reckoning</i>), meets the love of his life, Annie Lineberger, when they're both college students in North Carolina. When Annie breaks up with him, he tells her to get out of his car. She scrambles out and is never seen again. Grayson is the primary suspect in her disappearance, but without any evidence he moves on always followed by a cloud. In 2016, Annie's bones are found in Portman, Va., and Grayson's nightmare begins again. He gets support from only a few people, including Richmond, Va., reporter Willie Black (the lead of Owen's <i>The Devil's Triangle</i> and five other mysteries). Arrayed against him are public opinion, seemingly every lawman in the area, and Annie s unforgiving brother, Hayden. The discovery of Grayson's high school senior class ring, which he last saw when he refused to take it back from Annie at the time she left him, puts Grayson on a tortuous path that eventually leads to answers that may or may not explain what happened. This tale of loss and redemption will resonate with many readers. --<b>Publishers Weekly</b><br><br>After reading of Annie's love 'em-and-leave-'em attitude toward the men she dates, in spite of Gray's excuse that she was simply "young and wanted to be free," some readers may judgmentally conclude she got what she deserved, while others may take a more sympathetic attitude because of the time in which she lived. Whichever opinion is reached, both may be true to some extent. Annie's Bones is an intriguing story, as well as a sad one, for a life lost and a life ruined, and the reader will applaud how Gray's perseverance eventually rises him above his "outrageous fortune." --<b>New York Journal of Books</b></p><h2>Blenheim and the Churchill Family: A Personal Portrait</h2><p>Blenheim and the Churchill Family</p><p>Henrietta Spencer-Churchill is the daughter of the 11th Duke of Marlborough and spent her childhood surrounded by the exquisite architecture of Blenheim Palace.

He was a Red Cloud Kelpie, a breed of sheepdog known for its energy and cleverness. But Red Dog was a kind of ultra-Kelpie, energetic and clever enough for an entire breed in himself.<br><br>Dubbed a &#x201c;professional traveler&#x201d; rather than a stray, Red Dog established his own transportation system, hitchhiking between far-flung towns and female dogs in cars whose engine noises he&#x2019;d memorized and whose drivers he&#x2019;d charmed. The call of the wild was matched by the call of the supper dish; Red Dog&#x2019;s appetite was as legendary as his exploits. Everyone wanted to adopt him (one group of workers made him a member of their union), but Red Dog would be adopted by&#x2014;or, more precisely, he would adopt&#x2014;only one man: a bus driver whose love life quickly began to suffer and who never quite recovered from Red Dog&#x2019;s relentlessly affectionate presence.<br><br>Independent, clever, sly, stubborn, courageous and foolhardy, impatient with boredom and the boring, Red Dog endeared himself to (almost) everyone who crossed his path.

Intrigued, he made inquiries, and was swamped by locals with tales of a wildly charismatic creature named Tally Ho. De Berni�res, author of <i>Corelli's Mandolin</i>, has fashioned a charming picaresque of Tally's misdeeds and misadventures, not least of which involve the animal's enormous appetite (complemented by an equally enormous flatulence). "Tally," he writes, "was the most notorious canine dustbin in the whole neighbourhood. With apparent relish he ate paper bags, sticks, dead rats, butterflies, apple peel, eggshells, used tissues and socks." De Berni�res' enchantment with this "dustbin" is a reflection of a larger rapture: here is a writer who has fallen for Australia itself. He wittily captures the country's cadences, its landscape, its weakness for the (literal) underdog. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>&#x201c;<b>Red Dog</b> is vintage de Berni�res, abounding with gentle humour, compassion and respect.&#x201d; -- <i>The Financial Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;De Berni�res&#x2019; short, very sweet &#x2018;biography&#x2019; of a highly engaging animal is a particular treat.&#x201d; -- <i>The Observer</i><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Naoki Urasawa&#39;s Monster, Vol. 2</h2><p>Brilliant doctor Kenzo Tenma risks his reputation and promising career to save the life of a critically wounded young boy. Unbeknownst to him, this child is destined for a terrible fate. Conspiracies, serial murders, and a scathing depiction of the underbelly of hospital politics are all masterfully woven together in this compelling manga thriller.</p><p>Naoki Urasawa&#39;s career as a manga artist spans more than twenty years and has firmly established him as one of the true manga masters of Japan. Born in Tokyo in 1960, Urasawa debuted with BETA! in 1983 and hasn&#39;t stopped his impressive output since. Well-versed in a variety of genres, Urasawa&#39;s oeuvre encompasses a multitude of different subjects, such as a romantic comedy (Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl), a suspenseful human drama about a former mercenary (Pineapple ARMY; story by Kazuya Kudo), a captivating psychological suspense story (Monster), a sci-fi adventure manga (20th Century Boys), and a modern reinterpretation of the work of the God of Manga, Osamu Tezuka (Pluto: Urasawa x Tezuka; co-authored with Takashi Nagasaki, supervised by Macoto Tezka, and with the cooperation of Tezuka Productions). Many of his books have spawned popular animated and live-action TV programs and films, and 2008 saw the theatrical release of the first of three live-action Japanese films based on 20th Century Boys. No stranger to accolades and awards, Urasawa is a three-time recipient of the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award, a two-time recipient of the Osamu Tezuka Cultural Prize, and has received the Kodansha Manga Award. Similarly, Monster has been nominated three times for the Eisner Award in America. Urasawa has also become involved in the world of academia, and in 2008 accepted a guest teaching post at Nagoya Zokei University, where he teaches courses in, of course, manga.</p><h2>I the Supreme (Latin American Literature Series)</h2><p>Latin America has seen, time and again, the rise of dictators, Supreme Leaders possessed of the dream of absolute power, who sought to impose their mad visions of Perfect Order on their own peoples.

Every terminal disease known to humanity, those meant nothing to her. But the damnable cold that she was currently suffering through was hammering her, and Morgan was not a particularly good sick person, since it happened to her so rarely. She tended to become somewhat fetal, lie about and complain incessantly. When she was sick, she felt as if she were in a deep hole that she would be trapped in the rest of her life. And considering the fact that she was -- to the best of her knowledge -- virtually immortal, the rest of her life tended to seem a very long time. </p><p> She could have consulted with Doctor Selar about it, but in many ways, being sick was preferable. Ever since she had reached the final weeks of her pregnancy, Selar -- never exactly renowned for her bedside manner -- had become more distant, unfeeling and cold than ever before. It was not as if she were incapable of carrying out her duties; she was as capable of diagnosis and treatment as ever. She was just...so damned unpleasant. Her speech pattern had become flat and mechanical -- even more mechanical than the computer. It was downright chilling just to be around her. Morgan didn't know whether all Vulcans were like that in the last stages of pregnancy, but if they were, then she pitied Vulcan husbands everywhere. </p><p> "No wonder Spock's father married an earth female," she murmured. "Probably went a long way toward saving his sanity." She hated the way her voice sounded. She hated the way her head was pounding. She hated herself. </p><p> At least Robin wasn't around to see it. She was busy at the banquet, which was enough to make Morgan insanely jealous. Here she was, flat on her back, and her daughter was organizing a wonderful, semi-formal get-together designed to welcome the long lost sister of Si Cwan to the good ship <i>Excalibur.</i> All of the senior officers were going to be there and, frankly, it was going to be a good opportunity for Robin to impress her superior officers with her organizational skill. In a way, it seemed a rather trivial exercise. All the solid duties that Robin carried off in the course of a day should have been more than enough to warrant attention and promotion from the rank of ensign which she currently carried. Yet the simple truth was that people could be impressed by the damnedest things, and Captain Mackenzie Calhoun and Commander Elizabeth Shelby might be just as likely to find her duties as hostess as memorable as anything she did at ops. It didn't make any sense, but people were just funny that way. </p><p> Morgan could see the gathering in her mind's eye. There would be Calhoun and Shelby, bantering over brisket or some such preparation. Their attraction for each other was electric, and their knack for short-circuiting that same attraction was just amazing. And there would be Si Cwan, tall, noble and proud, with his young sister, Kalinda, next to him. Morgan had only caught a brief glimpse of her, having contracted her illness right after Kalinda ("Kally" as he called her) had come on board. The girl had looked older than she had originally envisioned her, equivalent to an earth child in her late teens instead of the very young girl that Si Cwan had always described. Morgan reflected that perhaps the way he described her was the way he saw her. She couldn't help but wonder whether that attitude might cause problems down the line. </p><p> This new fellow, Xyon, she hadn't seen at all. Supposedly he was the son of Captain Calhoun, but no one seemed to know quite what to make of that. Well, whatever the situation between them was, certainly it could all be worked out. Calhoun was nothing if not innovative when it came to the realm of personal relationships. </p><p> The door to the quarters slid open and Morgan, using what little energy she had, half propped herself up in her bed as she called out, "Robin! How did it go...honey..." </p><p> The term of endearment died in her throat as she saw the dishevelled condition of her daughter. </p><p> The front of Robin's dress uniform was covered in what appeared to be frosting. There was a small bruise on her forehead, and her hair -- which had been neatly arrayed in a very becoming 'do -- was hanging down around her face. Her expression was carefully stoic. </p><p> "It could have gone better," Robin said. </p><p> "My God! What happened?!" </p><p> Robin said nothing at first. Instead she walked across the room to the closet, from which she withdrew a towel. She used it to start wiping away the frosting from her uniform and the ends of her hair. </p><p> "Robin! Tell me what happened!" </p><p> "This," Robin said slowly, tapping the frosting which was now covering the towel, "was the welcome aboard cake. It had Xyon and Kalinda's names on it. Apparently, however, the cake also had my name on it." </p><p> "What do you mean?" </p><p> "I mean I was the one who wound up wearing a good deal of it, so that's why I said it had my name on it." </p><p> "I still don't understand..." </p><p> Robin sighed deeply as she peeled off her uniform to toss it into the ship's laundry. "There was some friction." </p><p> "Seems to me more like there was total combustion." </p><p> "Xyon," continued Robin, as if her mother had not spoken, "is having a bit of difficulty working and playing well with others." </p><p> "What others?" </p><p> "Captain Calhoun. Oh, and Si Cwan." </p><p> "What happened?" asked Morgan. </p><p> Robin sagged into a chair as she pulled on a short bathrobe. Her hair was still a mess, and the bruise was getting darker. She ran her fingers sadly through her hair and shook her head as she looked into a mirror and apparently wondered whether she was, in fact, the individual in the reflection. "It started nicely enough," she recounted. "Everyone was standing about, chatting. Everyone except Xyon. He didn't seem especially happy to be there. I went over to him and asked him if something was bothering him. He told me all he really wanted to do was get his ship fully repaired. Apparently his ship sustained some damage in escaping the nebula surrounding Star 7734, and there were some other repairs made to it that were simply stopgap in nature to begin with. His ship really needed an overhaul, and Captain Calhoun was more than happy to offer it since Xyon had been of such help in the entire Kalinda affair." </p><p> "So?" prompted Morgan. </p><p> "So he was spending the party keeping in a corner off to himself. In retrospect, if he'd just been left there by everyone, allowed to stew in his own juices and maybe be sociable on his own terms, then maybe matters would have turned out differently. </p><p> "But no, not our crew. First there's Captain Calhoun, trying to engage the boy in conversation. Now Xyon, he's making it clear to the captain that he's not interested in talking to him. Apparently there was some sort of falling out, or Xyon felt that Calhoun hadn't been much of a family, or something like that. In any event, Xyon was brushing him off. Everyone saw it. It was openly disrespectful. But it was obvious to everyone that the captain didn't want to make a big deal about it. That his attitude was, 'If this is how Xyon feels, I'm not going to fight with him about it. Let him work it out on his own.' Which was pretty sporting of him, if you ask me, considering that the first time they met each other, Xyon hauled off and slugged the captain." </p><p> "Yes, I know. Word of that spread rather quickly," Morgan said with a dry sense of irony. "Xyon was fortunate that the captain simply rubbed his chin and turned the other cheek, so to speak. I have no doubt that the captain could put him through a bulkhead if he were inclined to do so." </p><p> "Well, he almost had the inclination," said Robin. "After he brushed off the captain, Xyon started to leave the party." </p><p> "Did he have any of the buffet before left?" </p><p> Robin stopped talking and stared at her. "The what?" </p><p> "The buffet." </p><p> "Mother, who cares?" </p><p> "I do. You worked very hard to set it up." </p><p> "I don't know if he did. I don't care. The point is, he started to leave...and then Kalinda stopped him. She seemed very anxious to talk to him. She sat down with him and soon they were laughing and having a grand time." </p><p> "Oh! Well, that's good," said Morgan. </p><p> "No, that was bad," Robin corrected her. "Because apparently Si Cwan decided to become overprotective of her. So he rather politely asked Xyon to stop monopolizing her time." </p><p> "Oh. That's bad." </p><p> "No, that was good," said Robin. "Because at least he was polite about it. He was nothing but civil to Xyon." </p><p> "Oh. So that's good." </p><p> "No, that was bad, because Xyon took offense anyway. I believe he said, 'After everything I've been through to save your sister, I can't believe that you would try to prevent me from having some private time with her.'" </p><p> "Oooo...that is bad." </p><p> "No, that was actually good. Because Captain Calhoun overheard, and stepped in on his son's behalf, telling Si Cwan that Xyon was absolutely right, and Si Cwan should give them some distance." </p><p> "Oh! Well, that's good." </p><p> "No, that's bad. Because Xyon told the captain that he could handle the situation himself." </p><p> "Well, that's..." Morgan stopped, frowned, and then shook her head. "I lost track. Are we up to bad or good?" </p><p> "It doesn't matter. The point is that Xyon put his arm around Kalinda and tried to walk out of the room with her. I don't know whether he did it in order to show that no one told him what to do, or in order to annoy Si Cwan, or what. But Si Cwan grabbed him and pulled him away, telling him that no one manhandles a princess of Thallon. And then Xyon shoved Si Cwan, and Si Cwan shoved him back, and the captain got in the middle and there was more shouting..." She shook her head in disbelief. "It's hard to understand how it spiralled out of control, that quickly. One minute I was standing there chatting with Shelby about something perfectly innocuous, and the next thing I know, someone is slamming into me -- " </p><p> "You were attacked!" Morgan's voice bordered on outrage. </p><p> "Not exactly. More like, I got hit on the rebound. And I fell into the cake. And there was more shouting, and anger, and security showed up as Lieutenant Kebron restored order pretty quick, but they needed a cleanup crew and..." She put her face in her hands. "God, what a mess." </p><p> "Robin, it wasn't your fault..." </p><p> "And if everything had gone swimmingly, Mother, that would have been something I'd get the credit for, right? So when it turns into a debacle, as this did, who are they going to blame?" </p><p> "You're being much too hard on yourself." She coughed several times to try and clear out her lungs. </p><p> "Maybe I deserve it. I mean, look at the way things are going, Mother. Maybe fate is trying to tell me something." </p><p> "Tell you what? I don't understand -- " </p><p> "Well, first I decided to tell Si Cwan that I have strong feelings for him and that I wanted to accompany him on the mission to Montos...except by the time I did it, he was gone. And then I offered to conduct the entire reception, arrange everything, set it all up, mostly to make him happy...and it became a huge misfire. Maybe somebody up there," and she pointed, "is trying to tell me something." </p><p> Morgan looked up to where Robin was pointing. "Up there? You mean on the bridge?" </p><p> "No, Mother!" she said in exasperation. "I mean 'up there.' You know. Divine intervention may be trying to get a point across." </p><p> "You're overthinking it, Robin." </p><p> "No, I'm not. Nothing goes right for me." </p><p> "Now you're just dissolving into self-pity, Robin. I won't have it," Morgan said sternly. "You're made of better and stronger stuff than that. So instead of complaining about how everything goes wrong for you, just pull yourself together, and be the officer and the woman that I know you can be. Clear?" </p><p> Robin's jaw twitched in irritation, but finally she sighed heavily and said, "Clear." </p><p> She went into the bathroom and took a shower. By the time she came out, she was sneezing and her temperature was starting to climb. As she blew her nose, she looked daggers at her mother. "Thanks, Ma. I'm sure the cold you've apparently just given me will serve me as well as your advice." </p><p> Morgan rolled her eyes and pulled the covers over her head. As one, they sneezed. </p><p><br> Xyon sat in his quarters, chair tilted back, whistling softly. He was bare to the waist, having cleaned up after the debacle originally intended as a welcoming banquet for Rie -- for Kalinda. He had to keep reminding himself that her real name was Kalinda. His long blond hair was newly cleaned and hanging around his muscled shoulders. There was a chime at his door. "You can't come in," he called. "Apparently I have misbehaved and am in isolation." </p><p> The door slid open and Mackenzie Calhoun was standing in the doorway. "Actually, what with being the captain and all, I can come and go as I wish." </p><p> "That is what you excel at, isn't it? Going? As you went from Xenex after leaving my mother pregnant with me?" </p><p> Calhoun sighed deeply. "Xyon...grow up. Whatever disputes you have with me, they don't begin to excuse what took place at the banquet." </p><p> "I'm not looking to excuse myself to you, Captain. I don't care what you think." </p><p> Calhoun shook his head. "That's not true. If you didn't care what I thought, you would not have acted, and reacted, as you did. You would have ignored me, or brushed me off. You would not have taken a swing at me, certainly, and tried to hurt me." </p><p> "I didn't try. I did hurt you." </p><p> "No. You couldn't. Particularly if I'm ready for you." </p><p> Xyon's eyes flashed. "Is that a challenge?" </p><p> "No. Simply a statement of fact." </p><p> Instantly, Xyon was out of his chair. It was an impressive burst of speed. Anyone else would have been very hard-pressed to get out of his way. </p><p> Calhoun sidestepped and drove his knee up into Xyon's midsection. Xyon gasped and Mackenzie slammed him in the back of the neck, sending Xyon to the floor. Xyon lay there, momentarily stunned. He couldn't understand it. He was as formidable a fighter as they came, and had handled any number of opponents with facility. So what in hell had just happened? </p><p> As if reading his mind, Calhoun sat down next to him and said, "You rushed it. Also, you were probably a bit daunted by the fact that I am your father." </p><p> "I wasn't...daunted." </p><p> "My mistake, then," Calhoun said, sounding oversolicitous. </p><p> There was dead silence in the room then for an uncomfortable period of time. "How is Catrine?" Calhoun asked finally. </p><p> "My mother is fine. I'm sure she hardly thinks of you at all." </p><p> "That's...good." </p><p> "How could you have done it?" He was shaking his head in slow disbelief. </p><p> "Xyon...certainly you must know the circumstances of your conception?" </p><p> "I know, I know. Mother wanted to continue the family line, her late husband had been dead a year, and you, as Warlord of Xenex, in keeping with tradition, accommodated her by producing me. Hurray for you. Hurray for tradition." </p><p> "You don't know...you can't und...</p></p><h2>In the Master&#39;s Steps: The Gospels in the Land (The Carta New Testament Atlas, 1)</h2><p><i>In the Master's Steps</i>, the first of four atlases in The Carta New Testament Atlas series, sheds fresh light on the Gospels by focusing on the physical setting for the life of Jesus, and includes recent advances in history, geography, toponomy, and archaeology. <i>In the Master's Steps</i> assists the reader to hear more clearly the message Jesus&nbsp; proclaimed by providing a better understanding of the physical setting and events from his extraordinary life.</p><p><b>R.

With one jerk of a lanyard, one shell arching into the sky, years of tension explode into civil war. And for those men who do not know in which direction their loyalty calls them, it is a time for decisions. Such a one is Lieutenant Samuel Bowater, an officer of the U.S. Navy and a native of Charleston, South Carolina.</p><p>Hard-pressed to abandon the oath he swore to the United States, but unable to fight against his home state, Bowater accepts a commission in the nascent Confederate Navy, where captains who once strode the quarterdecks of the world's most powerful ships are now assuming command of paddle wheelers and towboats. Taking charge of the armed tugboat Cape Fear, and then the ironclad Yazoo River, Bowater and his men, against overwhelming odds, engage in the waterborne fight for Southern independence.</p></p><p><p>James L. Nelson has served as a seaman, rigger, boatswain, and officer on a number of sailing vessels.

This time his hero is an officer in the battered and ill-equipped Confederate Navy during the American Civil War. Shortly after the fall of Fort Sumter in 1861, Lt. Samuel Bowater resigns his commission in the U.S. Navy, torn between his pledge of loyalty to the Union and his loyalty to his home state, South Carolina. Aided by his family's influence and his previous military experience, he joins the fledgling Confederate Navy, where he is assigned to be captain of an old steam-powered tugboat converted into a gunboat. Like all of Nelson's captains, Bowater is bright, brave, resourceful and disciplined. His crew, however, is a motley collection of landsmen and sailors, men who fall under the influence of the enigmatic chief engineer, Hieronymus Taylor, the violin-playing dictator of the engine room. With the old gunboat and an unpredictable crew, Bowater is at quite a disadvantage in his battles with the powerful Union navy, especially during the spectacular battle for Roanoke Island. Meanwhile, a Mississippi plantation owner, Robley Paine, loses his three sons at the first battle of Bull Run, and he devises a crazy scheme to protect the river frontage of his property. Bowater, Taylor and the crew team up with Paine in a futile defense of New Orleans. This solid story is filled with Civil War and naval history, focusing on steam-powered warships and ironclads and on the courage of men who sailed into shot and shell for a hopeless cause. Nelson also adds suspense, romance and a bit of mystery, leaving plenty of room for the obvious sequel. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Secret of the Dread Forest (The Faire Folk Saga)</h2><p><p>Now that she has (sort of) defeated a diabolical elf, Keelie Heartwood reluctantly joins her father in the Dread Forest.

The attempt to manipulate the Western media, especially, was a fundamental dimension to the story, and one that affected some of the early reporting. <i>A Death in the Lucky Holiday Hotel</i> returns to the scene of the crime and shows not only what happened in Room 1605 but how the threat of the story was every bit as important in the life and death struggle for power that followed. It touched celebrities and billionaires and redrew the cast of the new leadership of the Communist Party. The ghost of Neil Heywood haunts China to this day.<br></p><p><b>Pin Ho</b>, a journalist and writer, is the founder of Mirror Media Groups and has covered Chinese politics for twenty-five years. He broke the news on leadership lineups for three consecutive Communist Party Congresses since 2002. His book, <i>China's Princelings</i>, was the first to coin that phrase to describe the children of Chinese revolutionaries, and is the source for much that has appeared in the accounts of various Western journalists.<br><br><b>Wenguang Huang</b> is a writer, journalist, and translator whose articles and translations have been published in the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, the <i>Paris Review</i>, and the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>.

The authors unravel the myriad threads of politburo-level power struggles which make the Borgias look like rank amateurs weaving together a narrative that includes obscene wealth and corruption, orgies, and totaled Ferraris on the streets of Beijing. This expert account is bolstered by the authors' willingness to admit that the story is so complex that unless Heywood's spirit can find a medium, the whole truth about the November 15 murder may never be known.'&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Winnipeg Free-Press</i></b><br> The authors have done an admirable job of sorting through the contradictions, half-truths and outright lies perpetrated by all the players in this drama.

What emerges is an immensely complicated tale of behind-the-scenes power struggles as full of scandal, ambition and betrayal as anything that ancient history has to offer . The authors' account has the considerable merit of understanding that the surface plot built around Heywood's murder isn't the most interesting element in this narrative. They show how Mr. Bo's undoing had its roots in the country's intense but normally invisible factional jousting . The narrative is thrilling and believable, based as it is on the information that Chinese officials leak to the press as part of their infighting . The overall picture of elite politics in China is a devastating one of wanton ambition and lawlessness.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>The Atlantic</i></b><br> A gripping telling of the incident that would make for a great thriller novel&#x2014;if it weren't all true.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Maclean's</i></b><br> As a lurid tale of wealthy and powerful people behaving badly, the authors' account of what has been unfolding in China since November 2011 can't be beat.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Kirkus</i></b><br> A true-crime&nbsp;murder mystery from 2011&nbsp;set in a remote Chinese city, with an outsized impact on governance of the vast nation .

He is also a pirate, an opium smuggler, and a master manipulator of men. This is the story of his fight to establish himself and his dynasty as the undisputed masters of the Orient.</p><p>James Clavell, who died in 1994, was a screenwriter, director, producer, and novelist born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Although he wrote the screenplays for a number of acclaimed films, including <i>The Fly</i> (1958), <i>The Great Escape</i> (1963), and <i>To Sir With Love</i> (1967), he is best known for his epic novels in his Asian Saga.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i><i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>"A pox on this stinking island," Brock said, staring around the beach and up at the mountains. "The whole of China at our feets and all we takes be this barren, sodding rock."<br><br>He was standing on the foreshore with two of his fellow China traders. Scattered about them were other clusters of traders, and officers from the expeditionary force. They were all waiting for the Royal Navy officer to begin the ceremony. An honor guard of twenty marines was drawn up in two neat lines beside the flagpole, the scarlet of their uniforms a sudden splash of color. Near them were the untidy knots of sailors who had just fought the flagpole into the stony soil.<br><br>"Eight bells were time to raise the flag," Brock said, his voice rasping with impatience. "It be an hour past. Wot's godrotting delay for?"<br><br>"It's bad joss to curse on a Tuesday, Mr. Brock," Jeff Cooper said. He was a lean, hook-nosed American from Boston, his frock coat black and his felt top hat set at a jaunty angle. "Very bad!"<br>Cooper's partner, Wilf Tillman, stiffened slightly, feeling the underlying edge to the younger man's nasal voice. He was thickset and ruddy, and came from Alabama.<br><br>"I'll tell thee right smartly, this whole godrotting flyspeck be bad joss!" Brock said. "Joss" was a Chinese word that meant Luck and Fate and God and the Devil combined. "Godrotting bad."<br><br>"It better not be, sir," Tillman said. "The future of the China trade's here now&#x2014;good joss or bad joss."<br><br>Brock stared down at him. "Hong Kong's got no future. It's open ports on the China mainland we be needing, and you knowed it, by God!"<br><br>"The harbor's the best in these waters," Cooper said. "Plenty of room to careen and refit all our ships. Plenty of room to build our homes and warehouses. And no Chinese interference at long last."<br><br>"A colony's got to have arable land and peasants to work the land, Mr. Cooper. An' revenue," Brock said impatiently. "I be walking all over and so have you. Not a crop'll grow here. There be no fields or streams, no grazing land. So no meat and no spuds. Everything we be needing'll have to come by sea. Think of the cost. Why, even the fishing be rotten. An' who's to pay upkeep of Hong Kong, eh? Us and our trade, by God!"<br><br>"Oh, that's the sort of colony you want, Mr. Brock?" Cooper said. "I thought the British Empire"&#x2014;he spat deftly to windward&#x2014;"had enough of that sort of colony."<br><br>Brock's hand strayed near his knife. "Be you spitting to clear yor throat, or spitting on the Empire?" Tyler Brock was nearing fifty, a big, one-eyed man as hard and as permanent as the iron he had been forced to peddle in Liverpool as a youth, and as strong and as dangerous as the fighting merchant ships he had escaped to and at length had come to rule as head of Brock and Sons. His clothes were rich and the knife at his belt was jeweled. His beard was graying like his hair.<br><br>"It's a cold day, Mr. Brock," Tillman said quickly, inwardly angry at his young partner's loose tongue. Brock was no man to bait, and they could not afford open enmity with him yet. "Plenty of chill on the wind, eh, Jeff?"<br><br>Cooper nodded briefly. But he did not take his eyes off Brock. He had no knife, but there was a derringer in his pocket. He was of a height with Brock but slighter, and unafraid.<br><br>"I be givin' thee piece of advice, Mr. Cooper," Brock said. "Best not spit too often after saying 'British Empire.' There be some wot baint be givin' thee benefit of doubt."<br><br>"Thank you, Mr. Brock, I'll remember," Cooper replied easily. "And I'll give you some advice: It's bad joss to curse on a Tuesday."<br><br>Brock suppressed his temper. Eventually he would crush Cooper and Tillman and their company, the biggest of the American traders. But now he needed them as allies against Dirk and Robb Struan. Brock cursed joss. Joss had made Struan and Company the greatest house in Asia, and so rich and powerful that the other China traders had named it in awe and jealousy The Noble House&#x2014;noble because it was first in riches, first in largess, first in trade, first in clippers, but mostly because Dirk Struan was Tai-Pan, the Tai-Pan among all the tai-pans of Asia. And joss had cost Brock an eye seventeen years ago, the year that Struan had founded his empire.<br><br>It had happened off Chushan Island. Chushan was just south of the huge port of Shanghai, near the mouth of the mighty Yangtse River. Brock had beaten up through the monsoon with a huge cargo of opium&#x2014;Dirk Struan a few days astern, also carrying opium. Brock had reached Chushan first, sold his cargo and turned around, knowing happily that now Struan would have to go farther north and try a new coast with fresh risks. Brock had sped south for home&#x2014;Macao&#x2014;his coffers filled with bullion, the full wind astern. Then a great storm had suddenly swooped out of the China seas. The Chinese called these storms tai-fung, the Supreme Winds. The traders called them typhoons. They were terror incarnate.<br><br>The typhoon had battered Brock's ship mercilessly, and he had been pinned by the falling masts and spars. A shorn halyard, caught by the winds, had flailed him as he lay helpless. His men had cut him loose but not before the broken shackle-ended rope had gouged out his left eye. The ship had been on her beam ends and he helped them cut the rigging and spars adrift, and by some miracle she had righted herself. Then he had poured brandy into the bleeding socket; he could still remember the pain.<br><br>And he recalled how he had limped into port long after he had been given up for lost, his fine three-masted clipper no more than a hulk, the seams sprung, masts and guns and rigging gone. And by the time Brock had replaced spars and rigging and masts and cannon and powder and shot and men, and bought another cargo of opium, all the profits of this voyage had vanished.<br><br>Struan had run into the same typhoon in a small lorcha&#x2014;a boat with a Chinese hull, English-rigged and used for coastal smuggling in fine weather. But Struan rode out the storm and, elegant and untouched as usual, had been on the dock to greet Brock, his strange green eyes mocking him.<br><br>Dirk and his cursed joss, Brock thought. Joss be letting Dirk build that one stinking lorcha into a fleet of clippers and hundreds of lorchas, into warehouses and bullion to spare. Into godrotting Noble House. Joss pushed Brock and Sons into godrotting second place. Second. And, he thought, joss's given him ear of our godrotting weak-gutted plenipotentiary, the Honorable Godrotting Longstaff, all these years. An' now, together, they've sold us out. "A&nbsp; pox on Hong Kong and a pox on Struan!"<br>"If it weren't for Struan's plan, you'd never have won your war so easily," Cooper said.<br><br>The war had begun at Canton two years before, when the Chinese emperor, determined to bring the Europeans to heel, tried to eliminate the opium smuggling which was essential to British trade. Viceroy Ling had surrounded the foreign settlement at Canton with troops, and demanded every case of opium in Asia to ransom the lives of the defenseless English traders. At length, twenty thousand cases of opium had been given over and destroyed, and the British were allowed to retreat to Macao. But the British could not take lightly either interference with its trade or threats to its nationals. Six months ago the British Expeditionary Force had arrived in the Orient and ostensibly had been placed under the jurisdiction of Longstaff, the Captain Superintendent of Trade.<br><br>But it was Struan who conceived the inspired plan to by-pass Canton, where all the trouble had started, and instead send the expeditionary force north to Chushan. To take that island without loss would be simple, Struan had theorized, for the Chinese were unprepared and helpless against any modern European army or fleet. Leaving a small holding force at Chushan and a few ships to blockade the Yangtse, the expeditionary force could sail north to the mouth of the Pei Ho River and threaten Peking, the capital of China, which was only a hundred miles upstream. Struan knew that only so direct a threat would make the emperor immediately sue for peace. A superb conception. And it had worked brilliantly. The expeditionary force had arrived in the Orient last June. By July Chushan had been taken. By August it was moored at the Pei Ho. In two weeks the emperor had sent an official to negotiate peace&#x2014;the first time in history that any Chinese emperor had officially acknowledged any European nation. And the war had ended with almost no loss to either side.<br><br>"Longstaff was very wise to follow the plan," Cooper said.<br><br>"Any China trader knowed how to bring the Chinee to their knees," Brock said, his voice rough. He pushed his top hat farther back on his forehead and eased his eye patch. "But why did Longstaff and Struan agree to negotiate back at Canton, eh? Any fool knowed 'negotiate' to a Chinee means to play for time. We should've stayed north at the Pei Ho till peace were signed. But no, we brung back the fleet and for the last six month we be waiting and waiting for the buggers to set pen to paper." Brock spat. "Stupid, crazy stupid. An' all that waste of time and money for this stinking rock. We should've kept Chushan. Now, there be island worth having." Chushan was twenty miles long and ten wide and its land fertile and rich&#x2014;a good port and a big city, Tinghai. "Space for a man to breathe in there, right enough. Why, from there three or four frigates can blockade the Yangtse at the drop of a topper. An' who controls that river controls the heart of China. That's where we should settle, by God."<br><br>"You still have Chushan, Mr. Brock."<br><br>"Yus. But it baint deeded in godrotting treaty, so it baint our'n." He stamped his feet against the growing chill wind.<br><br>"Perhaps you should mention it to Longstaff," Cooper said. "He's susceptible to advice."<br><br>"Not to mine, he baint. As thee rightly knowed. But I'll tell thee, when Parliament hear about the treaty, there be hell to pay, I'll be bound."<br><br>Cooper lit a cheroot. "I'm inclined to agree. It is an astonishing piece of paper, Mr. Brock. For this day and age. When every European power is land-_grabbing and power-hungry."<br><br>"And I suppose the United States baint?" Brock's face tightened. "Wot about yor Indians? The Louisiana Purchase? Spanish Florida? You be havin' eyes on Mexico and Russian Alaska. The last mails told you be even trying to steal Canada. Eh?"<br><br>"Canada's American, not English. We're not going to war over Canada&#x2014;she'll join us of her own free will," Cooper said, hiding his worry. He tugged at his muttonchop whiskers and pulled his frock coat tighter around his shoulders against the sharpening wind. He knew that war with the British Empire would be disastrous at this time, and would ruin Cooper-Tillman. God damn wars. Even so, he knew that the States would have to go to war over Mexico and Canada unless there was a settlement. Just as Britain had had to go to war with China.<br><br>"There won't be a war," Tillman said, trying to quiet Cooper diplomatically. He sighed and wished himself back in Alabama. A man can be a gentleman there, he thought. There you don't have to deal with the damned British every day, or with blasphemous, foulmouthed scum like Brock, or a devil incarnate like Struan&#x2014;or even with an impetuous young man and senior partner like Jefferson Cooper, who thinks Boston the center of the earth. "And this war's over, for better or worse."<br><br>"Mark my words, Mr. Tillman," Brock said. "This godrotting treaty be no good for us'n and no good for they. We've to keep Chushan and open ports on mainland China. We be at war again in a few weeks. In June when the wind be ripe and the weather be ripe, the fleet'll have to sail north to Pei Ho again. An' if we be at war again, how we going to get season's teas and silks, eh? Last year almost no trade because of war&#x2014;the year before no trade at all an' they stole all our opium to boot. Eight thousand cases from me alone. Two million taels of silver that cost me. Cash."<br><br>"That money's not lost," Tillman said. "Longstaff ordered us to give it up. To ransom our lives. He gave us paper on the British Government. And there's a settlement in the treaty. Six million taels of silver to pay for it."<br><br>Brock laughed harshly. "Thee think Parliament be honoring Longstaff's paper? Why, any Government'd be throwed out of office the moment they asked for the brass to pay for opium. An' as to the six million&#x2014;that be paying for the cost of the war. I knowed Parliament better'n you. Kiss yor half million taels goodbye be my advice to you both. So if we be at war again this year, there be no trade again. An' if we baint trading this year, we be all bankrupt. You, me, every China trader. An' even the godrotting Noble House." He jerked out his watch. The ceremony was to have started an hour ago. Time be running out, he thought. Yus, but not on Brock and Sons, by God. Dirk's had seventeen-year run of good joss, and now be time for change.<br><br>Brock reveled in the thought of his second son, Morgan, who capably&#x2014;and ruthlessly&#x2014;controlled all their interests in England. He wondered if Morgan had been successful in undermining Struan's influence in Parliament and in banking circles. We be going to wreck thee, Dirk, he thought, and Hong Kong along with thee. "Wot the hell be the delay for?" he said, hastening toward the naval officer who was striding up and down near the marines.<br><br>"What's the matter with you, Jeff? You know he's right about Hong Kong," Tillman said. "You ought to know better than to bait him."<br><br>Cooper smiled his thin smile. "Brock's so goddam sure of himself. I couldn't help it."<br><br>"If Brock's right about the half million taels, we're ruined."<br><br>"Yes. But Struan will lose ten times that if there's no payment. He'll get paid, never fear. So we'll get ours." Cooper looked after Brock. "Do you think he knows about our deal with Struan?"<br><br>Tillman shrugged. "I don't know. But Brock's right about the treaty. It's stupid. It'll cost us a pretty penny."<br><br>For the last three months Cooper-Tillman had been acting as secret agents for The Noble House. British warships had been blockading Canton and the Pearl River, and British traders were forbidden to trade. Longstaff&#x2014;at Struan's bidding&#x2014;had put the embargo on as another measure to force the peace treaty, knowing that the Canton warehouses were bulging with teas and silks. But since America had not declared war on China, American ships could go through the blockade freely and thumb their noses at the warships. So Cooper-Tillman had bought four million pounds of tea from Chen-tse Jin Arn&#x2014;or Jin-qua, as he was nicknamed&#x2014;the richest of the Chinese merchants, and shipped it to Manila, supposedly for Spanish merchants. The local Spanish official, for a considerable bribe, had issued the necessary import and export licenses, and the tea was transferred&#x2014;duty free&#x2014;into Struan's clippers and rushed to England. Payment to Jin-qua was a shipload of opium delivered secretly by Struan somewhere up the coast.</p><h2>Illusions</h2><p>A companion story to &#34;Jonathon Livingston Seagull&#34;.

Ira Levin's second novel (he went on to write such fine thrillers as <i>A Kiss Before Dying</i>, <i>The Stepford Wives</i>, and <i>The Boys from Brazil</i>), <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>, remains perhaps his best work. The author's mainstream "this is how it really happened" style undeniably also made the novel his most widely imitated. The plot line is deceptively simple: What if you were a happily married young woman, living in New York, and one day you awoke to find yourself pregnant? And what if your loving husband had--apparently--sold your soul to Satan? And now you were beginning to believe that your unborn child was, in reality, the son of Satan? Levin subtly makes it all totally plausible, unless of course, dear Rosemary--or the reader--can no longer distinguish fantasy from reality! A wonderfully chilling novel, it was later faithfully transformed into an equally unnerving motion picture. In 1997, a sequel was spawned, <i>Son of Rosemary</i>. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i>Ira Levin is the author of The Boys from Brazil, Sliver, The Stepford Wives, and other bestsellers, as well as Broadway&#39;s longest-running thriller, Deathtrap.

Handsomely presented in facing-page Spanish and English, this volume, translated by National Book Award winner Clayton Eshleman, includes the groundbreaking collections <i>The Black Heralds </i>(1918), <i>Trilce </i>(1922), <i>Human Poems </i>(1939), and <i>Spain, Take This Cup from Me </i>(1939).<br><br>Vallejo's poetry takes the Spanish language to an unprecedented level of emotional rawness and stretches its grammatical possibilities. Striking against theology with the very rhetoric of the Christian faith, Vallejo's is a tragic vision&#x2014;perhaps the only one in the canon of Spanish-language literature&#x2014;in which salvation and sin are one and the same. This edition includes notes on the translation and a fascinating translation memoir that traces Eshleman's long relationship with Vallejo's poetry. An introduction and chronology provide further insights into Vallejo's life and work.</p><p>"C�sar Vallejo is the greatest Catholic poet since Dante&#x2014;and by Catholic I mean universal."&#x2014;Thomas Merton, author of <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i><br><br>"An astonishing accomplishment. Eshleman's translation is writhing with energy."&#x2014;Forrest Gander, author of <i>Eye Against Eye</i><br><br>"Vallejo has emerged for us as the greatest of the great South American poets&#x2014;a crucial figure in the making of the total body of twentieth-century world poetry. In Clayton Eshleman's spectacular translation, now complete, this most tangled and most rewarding of poets comes at us full blast and no holds barred. A tribute to the power of the imagination as it manifests through language in a world where meaning has always to be fought for and, as here, retrieved against the odds."&#x2014;Jerome Rothenberg, co-editor of <i>Poems for the Millennium</i><br><br>"Every great poet should be so lucky as to have a translator as gifted and heroic as Clayton Eshleman, who seems to have gotten inside Vallejo's poems and translated them from the inside out. The result is spectacular, or as one poem says, 'green and happy and dangerous.'"&#x2014;Ron Padgett, translator of <i>Complete Poems</i> by Blaise Cendrars<br><br>"C�sar Vallejo was one of the essential poets of the twentieth century, a heartbreaking and groundbreaking writer, and this gathering of the many years of imaginative work by Clayton Eshleman is one of Vallejo's essential locations in the English tongue."&#x2014;Robert Hass, former Poet Laureate of the United States<br><br>"This is a crucially important translation of one of the poetic geniuses of the twentieth century." &#x2014;William Rowe, author of <i>Poets of Contemporary Latin America: History and the Inner Life</i><br><br>"Only the dauntless perseverance and the love with which the translator has dedicated so many years of his life to this task can explain why the English version conveys, in all its boldness and vigor, the unmistakable voice of C�sar Vallejo."&#x2014;Mario Vargas LlosaPoet and essayist <b>Clayton Eshleman </b>is a recipient of the National Book Award and the Landon Translation Prize.

But when the competition escalates into an all-out battle that's fought from the cafeteria of their New York City private school all the way to the fictional universe of an online video game, the twins have to decide if their efforts to destroy each other are worth the price. In a starred review, <i>Publishers Weekly</i> declared "This uproarious series opener... is packed with both laugh-out-loud moments and heart."<br><br>Don't miss the further adventures of the Tapper Twins in <i>The Tapper Twins Tear Up New York</i>, <i>The Tapper Twins Run for President</i>, and <i>The Tapper Twins Go Viral</i>.<br></p><p>Geoff Rodkey has written the hit films <i>Daddy Day Care </i>(starring Eddie Murphy), <i>RV</i> (starring Robin Williams), <i>The Shaggy Dog</i> (starring Tim Allen), and the Disney Channel original TV movie <i>Good Luck Charlie, It's Christmas.</i> He is also the author of the middle grade trilogy The Chronicles of Egg, and following next books in the Tapper Twins series: <i>The Tapper Twins Tear Up New York</i>, <i>The Tapper Twins Run for President</i>, and <i>The Tapper Twins Go Viral</i>. He lives in New York City.Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;What's wrong with a little pranking among siblings? Things couldn't possibly escalate, could they? Twelve-year-old twins Claudia and Reese Tapper live on the Upper West Side of New York City with their rather clueless, professional parents and a nice but also clueless nanny. In an effort to examine the events that led up to a full-scale war between the twins, Claudia decides to interview the combatants as well as a variety of allies and enemies, bystanders, and parents. The result is this "oral" history transcript complete with text messages, photographs, emails, and gaming chat logs. Like any self-respecting millennial, Claudia consults Wikipedia about war and sees parallels between World War I and her battles with Reese. And to think it all started with a misappropriated toaster cake. While there is plenty of hilarity, readers will experience many little pings of recognition; the dynamics between siblings and schoolmates rings true. Rodkey keeps the action moving and relatively light while maintaining a laser-beamlike eye on the complicated bond of twins, navigating the minefield that is middle school without judgment or didacticism. Fragile egos, misunderstandings, and actions that seemed like a good idea at the time are laid out in an engaging format that will be appealing to tween digital natives and fans of "Origami Yoda" (Abrams) and "Charlie Joe Jackson" (Roaring Brook). A fine beginning to a funny, new middle grade series.&#x2014;Brenda Kahn, Tenakill Middle School, Closter, NJ</p><h2>The Magic Lantern of Marcel Proust: A Critical Study of Remembrance of Things Past</h2><p><p>"[<i>The Magic Lantern of Marcel Proust</i>] reduces the ungainly and intricately designed masterpiece to its shape, and with hardly a wasted word...The paragraphs on habit and memory are truly wonderful wonderful as explication, as psychology, and as philosophy."

In this sixth entry in ISI Books&#x2019; Library of Modern Thinkers&#x2019; series, Mark T. Mitchell reveals how Polanyi came to recognize that the roots of the modern political and spiritual crisis lay in an errant conception of knowledge that served to foreclose any possibility of making meaningful statements about truth, goodness, or beauty. Polanyi&#x2019;s theory of knowledge as ineluctably personal but also grounded in reality is not merely of historical interest, writes Mitchell, for it proposes an attractive alternative for anyone who would reject both the hubris of modern rationalism and the ultimately nihilistic implications of academic postmodernism.</p><p><b>Mark T. Mitchell</b>, who took his doctorate in political theory from Georgetown University, is Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Political Theory at Patrick Henry College in Purcellville, Virginia. He has written on Polanyi, Eric Voegelin, and Michael Oakeshott for various journals and is currently finishing a book on rootlessness and democracy.</p><h2>Asterix Omnibus 8: Includes Asterix and the Great Crossing #22, Obelix and Co. #23, and Asterix in Belgium #24</h2><p>Asterix fans can now enjoy books 22 through 24 in a gorgeous special collector's edition!

In this riveting true story of the Middle Eastern Church struggling to come to grips with hostile governments, terrorist acts, and an influx of Muslims coming to Christ, readers will meet a group of men and women they never knew existed. The names and places have been changed to protect the real people in the real places. But the stories are true. In his most incredible and eye-opening book to date, Brother Andrew invites you to meet: � Ahmed, a young Muslim terrified by nightmares until he is introduced to Isa (Jesus) � Mustafa, a former leader in a fundamentalist Muslim movement that persecuted Christians � Salima, a privileged young Muslim woman who is held captive by her family when they find a Bible in her possession � Abuna, a priest faced with an aging congregation and constant threats to his beloved church � and many more.

In his most incredible and eye-opening book to date, Brother Andrew invites you to meet these brave men and women you never knew existed.

The names and places have been changed to protect the real people in the real places. But the stories are true.

It calls us to join a new kind of jihad, leaving vengeance behind in favor of forgiveness, radical love, and unyielding prayer. &#34;Brother Andrew and Al Janssen reveal the amazing stories of those who witness the love of One they once refused and passionately searched until they found Him, even in the face of great opposition. Theirs is a testament to meekness, grace, and triumph, and a call to every follower of Christ to mirror their example.&#34;--Ravi Zacharias, author and speakerIn 2 Timothy 4:7, Paul says, &#34;I have fought the good fight.&#34; In the Arabic translation those last three words are rendered &#34;the good jihad.&#34; Whether we want to be or not, we are engaged in this fight. But it is not the same fight that we see on the news. It is a spiritual battle. How are we Christians going to respond? With guns and bombs? Is that really our only option? This approach won&#39;t win a spiritual war. So just how do we fight a good spiritual jihad? To answer this question, we will look at a group of Christians who live under Islam. Yes, there is a church in the Islamic world. In some cases, the church is hidden and barely surviving. In other countries there has been a church since the time of Pentecost. These churches have seen the rise and advance of Islam. Often they have suffered terribly. We in the West have a crucial part to play in the good fight.</p><h2>Away with All Pests: An English Surgeon in People&#39;s China, 1954-1969</h2><p>Away with All Pests: An English Surgeon in People&#39;s China, 1954-1969</p><p></p><h2>Book of Flight: The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum</h2><p><p> The dream of flight is one of the oldest in human history.

After five centuries of sustained expansion, the half-dozen European powers that ruled half of humanity collapsed with stunning speed after World War II, creating a hundred emerging nations in Asia and Africa. Amid this imperial transition, the United States became the new global hegemon, dominating this world order with an array of power that closely resembled that of its European predecessors.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As Brazil, Russia, India, China, and the European Union now rise in global influence, twenty leading historians from four continents take a timely look backward and forward to discover patterns of eclipse in past empires that are already shaping a decline in U.S. global power, including:<br>� erosion of economic and fiscal strength needed for military power on a global scale<br>� misuse of military power through micro-military misadventures<br>� breakdown of alliances among major powers<br>� weakened controls over the subordinate elites critical for any empire&#x2019;s exercise of global power<br>� insufficient technological innovation to sustain global force projection.</p><p>Alfred W.

An alternate series to the original manga, Shooting Star is a space noir set at the end of the 21st century. The Bebop is a ship with an unusual crew of renegade space cowboys (or more accurately, interplanetary bounty hunters). This what-if story introduces Kai Lucas, who hires the Bebop's crew to track down his doppelganger. The crew, led by the reckless Spike Spiegel and Jet Black, a former member of the Inter Solar Systems Police, gradually grows to include its trademark ragtag assortment of eccentrics, like conniving con dame Faye Valentine, hacker Edward IV and Ein the hyper-intelligent dog. Through a convergence of fate and technology gone awry, Spike becomes one of space's Most Wanted, and the tables are turned: hunter becomes hunted as the crew get caught in space-mafia intrigue with Scorpion, the teenage leader of the Dragon Head family. Kai's decoy wreaks havoc, and mistaken identity, bait-and-switches and double-crosses ensue. It's one wild goose chase after another for the perpetually impoverished group. This volume is the second manga spin-off from the original anime series and is the same Cowboy Bebop in spirit but with a different story line; many characters are familiar, though they have modified origins and subtle personality differences (e.g., Spike's trademark unruly hairdo has been tamed). But it still continues the potent postmodern mix of sci-fi, wit, action and film noir that made the original series so outrageously popular. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It includes over 300 photos of listed establishments and it is a 5 1/2&#34; x 8 1/2&#34; format with spiral binding - like the EZ66 GUIDE For Travelers. These unique guides have been used by thousands around the world for over a decade to find the best places to stay and eat along the Route. It lists over 500 dining and lodging establishments objectively reviewed by Federation Adopt-A-Hundred members. (No advertising is allowed.) It concentrates on the vintage properties that made the Route famous. Price ranges, amenities, credit cards accepted, must stops and other specialty features are included. The guide covers all 8 states. An excellent traveling companion to the EZ66 GUIDE.</p><p>The National Historic Route 66 Federation can justly be credited with expanding Route 66 beyond the efforts of a few. This was accomplished by promoting the highway around the world, establishing a global Route 66 association and producing 3 to 4 day events along 66 that featured artists, musicians and collectors, and the John Steinbeck Awards evening that honored those working to restore the Route. The roots of the Federation go back to October of 1964, when David Knudson drove from Chicago to California on Route 66. Fresh out of college, he had pocket change, plenty of dreams and no job. He stayed in California and eventually built a business in Los Angeles. But, he never forgot his trip out Route 66 with all the enticing motor courts, exotic trading posts and the aroma of sweet smoke from the pit barbecues. He couldn t afford to stop at any of them on his way out, but he vowed one day, he d travel down Route 66 again and buy some Indian moccasins, sample the great smelling barbecue and stay in a few places with clean sheets. In August of 94, his chance came. His wife, Mary Lou and he were in Chicago and decided to drive back to California along Route 66. But, they couldn t find the fabled road. The world s most famous road wasn t on any maps and there were no 66 road signs. The old road had been bypassed by an interstate highway over 20 years before stranding many of the once-thriving businesses and towns. Deserted structures stood only as silent reminders of the days of America s Glory Road . By the time David and Mary Lou arrived home, they decided to sell their business interests and devote their time to trying to save as much as possible of the historic road before it was completely gone. The Federation was born. Today, the National Historic Route 66 Federation is the worldwide, nonprofit organization dedicated to directing the public s attention to the importance of U. S. Highway Route 66 in America s cultural heritage and acquiring the federal, state and private support necessary to preserve the historic landmarks and revitalize the economies of communities along the entire 2,400-mile stretch of road. The Federation accomplishes these goals through public education, advocacy and membership activities. Public outreach strategies include publication of the quarterly magazine Federation News, the Adopt-A-Hundred Preservation Program, a worldwide web site, serving on the National Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program, the Route 66 Dining and Lodging Guide, the EZ66 GUIDE For Travelers, special events - and assistance to the media, authors, learning institutions and production companies. The Federation spearheaded the National Route 66 Preservation Bill In 1999 which was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Clinton. The act provides $10 million in matching fund grants to individuals, corporations and communities for the purpose of preserving or restoring historic properties along the legendary route. The Federation s Adopt-A-Hundred Program utilizes over 20 volunteer members who take responsibility for 100 mile stretches of the route. They tour their stretches at least twice a year looking for possible preservation problems and if found, report them to the Federation for follow up. Every other year, those members who have adopted sections in the Adopt-A-Hundred Program travel their sections and review the dining and lodging establishments along them. Each facility is evaluated on 10 different criteria. Their detailed reports are then compiled and entered into the latest edition of the Route 66 Dining and Lodging Guide.</p><h2>The Adventures of Luther Arkwright</h2><p>Garth Ennis says of this collection, &#34;From riveting action scenes to beautiful silent sequences, from studies in hateful obsession to humor both ribald and gentle, The Adventures of Luther Arkwright is surely one of the all-time great epics of the medium. This long-overdue collection proves both Bryan Talbot&#39;s mastery of his craft and his understanding of what makes a truly great comic book: an intriguing story, characters with genuine resonance, and artwork whose illustrative excellence lies in perfect balance with clear and precise storytelling. With Luther Arkwright, Bryan shows us how it&#39;s done.&#34; &#34;A work ambitious in both scope and complexity that still stands unique upon the comics landscape . . . stunning,&#34; says Alan Moore.

But when he arrives at the metro station, where a woman named Philippa Goodwin threw herself in front of an underground train, Thorne inexplicably senses something awry and feels compelled to dig deeper. He soon discovers that she was the victim of a callous con-man who preys on vulnerable women, and whose deception plunged Philippa to her end. Thorne enlists DI Nicola Tanner to help him track down the swindler and bring him to justice. But the detective duo gets more than they bargained for when a young man&#x2019;s bludgeoned body turns up on the shore of a nearby seaside town.

A little girl awakens feeling there is nothing to look forward to and walks through her day oblivious to the small glimmer of hope that was always with her until the tree shows her.</p><p>Award-winning artist and author Shaun Tan has achieved international recognition for his work, including the CBCA Picture Book of the Year Award for The Rabbits (with J. Marsden), an Honor Book Award for Memorial (with G. Crew) and The Lost Thing, an APA Design Award, an Honorable Mention at the Bologna Book Fair, three Aurealis Awards, and Spectrum Gold and Silver Awards. In 2001 he was named best artist at the World Fantasy Awards in Montreal. A graduate of the University of Washington in 1995, with honors in fine arts and English literature, he lives in Perth, Australia. The Red Tree is his fifth book (and the first published in North America).Grade 3 Up-An astonishing fable in picture-book format. A girl moving through landscapes of hopelessness and isolation encounters an image of hope on the book's final page. Through the weight of her sorrow, readers conclude, on both intellectual and emotional levels, that living in despair is waiting for hope. Tan's sophisticated mixed-media illustrations include fantasy and dream elements, and subtle symbolism packed together with an array of art techniques ranging from complicated cut-paper collages to Drescher-like paintings, but serious. These complex pictures send visual impressions powerful enough to cause readers to gasp as a new page is revealed. The simple, direct text ("darkness overcomes you" or "sometimes you just don't know what you are supposed to do"), often poetic ("the world is a deaf machine"), serves both as an entryway into the complicated illustrations, and as an enhancement to them. Perhaps too sophisticated in its point of view for some youngsters, this is nonetheless a book of amazing beauty, high quality, and distinguished artistry.<br><i>Liza Graybill, Worcester Public Library, MA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Collected Poems and Selected Prose</h2><p>This volume contains all of Housman&#39;s poetry (including his nonsense verse) It also includes a selection of Housman&#39;s critical prose, notably his lecture &#34;On the Name and Nature of Poetry&#34;, as well as a selection from his letters.</p><p></p><h2>With Love (minedition minibooks)</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;Chimpanzees, more like us than any other living animal, form a living link between two worlds, human and non-human beings.

In turning, I hit a bayonet that had started into my chest and knocked it out of the way. It cut through my jacket and left a . . . gash through the flesh of my left chest. I had a pistol in my hand; it was cocked and loaded but I didn&#x2019;t shoot the man. I hit him in the face with it . . . as hard as I could. He immediately dropped the rifle, which I took and bayoneted him. I pulled it out and started yelling. . . .&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <i>Last Man Standing</i> draws on never-before-published personal interviews from the controversial and bloody Peleliu campaign. Conceived to protect MacArthur&#x2019;s flank in the Philippines, most historians feel the operation was unnecessary after U.S. carrier raids had eliminated Japanese airpower. The men who survived the terrible slaughter describe brutal combat, often face to face, against an implacable foe. <i>Last Man Standing</i> highlights the actions of the legendary Col. &#x201c;Chesty&#x201d; Puller, who repeatedly ordered attacks into the teeth of the enemy fortifications as his regiment was decimated, and Maj. Gen. William Rupertus, the division commander who refused to bring in Army reinforcements. It is an exciting account of combat action, brought to life through the Marine Corps History Division&#x2019;s vast oral history and photographic collection.<p><i>Last Man Standing</i> draws on Dick Camp&#x2019;s extensive personal interviews and close association with two of the 1st Regiment&#x2019;s battalion commanders&#x2014;Ray Davis and Russ Honsowetz. The author was 1st Battalion commander Ray Davis&#x2019; aide de camp for almost two years, and during that time they had many discussions about Peleliu, which Davis considered to be one of the bloodiest battles in Marine Corps history. His battalion, 1/1, landed in reserve yet had to fight its way across the beach. Davis was wounded almost immediately but refused evacuation and continued to lead his men for the next three weeks before being relieved. During that time his battalion suffered an incredible 71% casualty rate, undoubtedly the highest in Marine Corps history.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> Camp also extensively interviewed Russ Honsowetz, one of the other battalion commanders. Colonel Honsowetz was considered to be an &#x201c;old war horse,&#x201d; an infantry commander whose bravery and combat leadership were without parallel. They talked of his experiences on Peleliu over the course of several months. In addition, Camp has made extensive use of the Marine Corps History Division&#x2019;s vast oral history and photographic collection, as well as the personal papers archive of the Gray Research Center, to re-create the bloody and reckless action on Peleliu.</p><h2>Highway 61: Heart of the Delta</h2><p>A visual celebration of the Mississippi Delta brings together a collection of essays, interviews, folklore, poetry, and other writings with vivid photographs that document the region, its rich history and culture, and its dynamic and diverse population.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;For the expatriate, Highway 61 pulls you irresistibly back to the storied <br>places, dark history and budding hope that lie waiting in the long, flat <br>richness of&nbsp; the Delta.

The essay writers touch on a variety of themes from cultural landmarks to racial issues to the struggle for Civil Rights, providing the reader with a guide to important themes of the area&#x2019;s history and culture. <br> <br>The section &#x201c;Voices of the Delta&#x201d; includes interviews with nearly thirty people of different ethnicities and social classes who share their knowledge of the past and their hopes for the future.&nbsp; Their stories remind the reader that the Delta is not stuck in a particular time or place in which bad memories, history, and dark images forever hold residents captive.&nbsp; Instead, the region is populated by dynamic men and women whose individual voices, when combined, reveal a powerful force for positive change. &nbsp; <br> <br>Jean-Philippe Cypr�s&#x2019;s lens captures the people, places, and spirit of the Delta.&nbsp; There are photos of the smiling doormen who escorts the ducks on their afternoon stroll through the lobby of the Peabody Hotel in Memphis; the neon-encrusted, twenty-story casino rising high above Tunica; the burial place of Sonny Boy Williamson, which has become a memorial to the legendary harmonica player; the mansions of Vicksburg; a group of World War II veterans at the town&#x2019;s V.F.W. club; and many more fresh, compelling images. &nbsp; <br> <br>Through text and photos, Highway 61 reveals the living, beating, ever-changing heart of the Mississippi Delta. <br> <br>Randall Norris is a professor of English and American culture studies at Sauk Valley Community College in Dixon, Illinois.&nbsp; He is the author of Women of Coal.&nbsp; With Jean Philippe Cypr�s, he developed a traveling exhibit of text and images on the Mississippi Delta under the auspices of the Mississippi Humanities Council and the Phil Hardin Foundation. <br> <br>Jean-Philippe Cypr�s is an award-winning photographer originally from Paris, France, where he studied with internationally known photographer Cees De Hand.

To judge by their frequent appearances in art and literature, they also figure among the most venerated. The legends of virgin martyrs, retold in various ways through the centuries, illuminate trends in popular piety, values, and literary tastes.</p><p><i>Chaste Passions</i> contains sixteen English virgin martyr legends, each of a different saint and each translated into colloquial, modern English prose. Faithful in tone and meaning to the originals, Karen Winstead's lively translations allow contemporary readers to appreciate why virgin martyr legends thrived for hundreds of years. Winstead presents the tales in chronological order, tracing the effects of the composition and tastes of the audience on the development of the genre.</p><p>The virgin martyr, Winstead tells us, escapes the confining female stereotypes&#x2015;demure maiden or disruptive shrew&#x2015;prevalent in writings of the period. Because nearly all of the texts were written by men but addressed to women, they exhibit a fascinating interplay between male views of so-called women's literature and the demands of their intended audience.</p><p>Familiarity with this widely read genre is essential to a full understanding of medieval culture, and Chaste Passions is an excellent introduction to these often racy, sometimes comic, tales.</p></p><p><p>Karen A. Winstead, Associate Professor of English at The Ohio State University, is the author of<i> Virgin Martyrs: Legends of Sainthood in Late Medieval England</i>, also from Cornell.</p><p>"<i>Chaste Passions</i> provides a wonderful introduction to the genre. Although the book is accessible to those new to the field, even specialists in Middle English will use and appreciate Karen Winstead's selection of vernacular legends, her knowledgeable introductions and bibliographies, and her colorful, idiomatic translations of the texts themselves."</p> (Sherry Reames, University of Wisconsin, Madison)<br><br><p>"Karen Winstead does a great service in collecting these previously unavailable tales. Her high-quality translations are more than readable&#x2015;they are lively and entertaining. <i>Chaste Passions</i> allows modern readers to get a sense of why these tales&#x2015;often racy, even salacious, and sometimes quite comic&#x2015;were so appealing to medieval audiences."</p> (Laurie Finke, Kenyon College)<br><br><p>"Although virgin martyrs have often been regarded as prototypical female victims, the feisty heroines who emerge from Karen Winstead's lively translations face their oppressors with spirit, eloquence and even, occasionally, colorful profanity. These delightful legends by diverse writers assembled in<i> Chaste Passions </i>testify to the versatility and popularity of the virgin martyr figure in later medieval culture."</p> (Kathleen Ashley, University of Southern Maine)</p><h2>HAPPY ORPHELINE (Orphelines)</h2><p>Twenty orphan girls are so happy together that they do not want to be adopted--and will do just about anything to prevent it</p><p></p><h2>The Christian imagination: Essays on literature and the arts</h2><p>former student copy, some text is highlighted</p><p></p><h2>Desolation Road</h2><p>Relates the history of a bizarre little town on the edge of the Martian desert over the course of its thirty-year existence</p><p><b>Ian McDonald</b>&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;<i>Planesrunner,&nbsp;Be My Enemy</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Empress of the Sun</i>, in the Everness series.

In its scope, intelligence and elegance, <b>The Stranger&#x2019;s Child</b> can be placed in the great tradition of the novel alongside epics by Marcel Proust and Anthony Powell. And yet, in its subtly political exploration of homosexuality in English society, it deals with an utterly contemporary subject in an utterly contemporary way.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>The Stranger&#x2019;s Child</b><i> </i>begins with sixteen-year-old Daphne Sawle sitting in a hammock in the garden of Two Acres, the family home in suburban London. She is making a show of reading Tennyson before her brother George arrives to visit with his Cambridge friend Cecil Valance, a handsome, assured and sometimes outrageous young man with a burgeoning reputation as a poet. After a tantalizing and dramatic weekend Cecil writes a long poem in Daphne&#x2019;s autograph album as a parting gift. It is titled &#x201c;Two Acres,&#x201d; and both Daphne and George (whose feelings for Cecil also go well beyond mere friendship) immediately see how important the poem is &#x2013; but none of them can foresee the complex and lasting effects it will have on all their lives. <br>&nbsp;<br>When the next section of the novel begins, everything has changed: Daphne is married to Cecil&#x2019;s brother Dudley Valance; George to a historian named Madeleine; and Cecil is dead, killed by a sniper in World War One. A Cabinet officer and man of letters named Sebastian Stokes has come to Corley Court, the Valance family&#x2019;s country home, to put together an edition of Cecil&#x2019;s poems<b> </b>and speak to each family member in turn about him. He is especially curious about Cecil&#x2019;s personal (and passionate) letters and unpublished poems, papers that seem to have gone missing, and whose absence will loom paradoxically through the rest of the novel.<b> </b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>The book leaps forward and we are at another party, this one to celebrate Daphne&#x2019;s seventieth birthday. George is now the acclaimed historian G.F. Sawle; Daphne&#x2019;s son Wilfrid, a charming boy in the previous section, has grown into a nervous and somehow fractured adult. We meet Peter Rowe, a music teacher at the boarding school that now occupies Corley Court, and his boyfriend, Paul Bryant, a bank employee with a feeling for Cecil&#x2019;s poetry. Soon Paul is taking up an idea that Peter abandoned: to write a biography of Cecil Valance. It means making some startling discoveries about a past that the Valance family would prefer to keep in sepia and shadows.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>The Stranger&#x2019;s Child</b><i> </i>is by turns a gripping literary mystery, an absorbing social study of some pivotal moments in history, and a sensuous and beautiful exploration of the secret passions that determine our lives. From Edwardian suburbs to the offices of the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> in the 1970s, from High Table wit to the realities of life working behind the counter at a provincial bank, it seems there is no corner of English life that Alan Hollinghurst cannot make present and palpable. Throughout this book he displays his unmatched gift for creating characters who live and breathe, and makes <b>The Stranger&#x2019;s Child</b><i> </i>that rare thing, a historical novel whose characters, in their passions and betrayals, constantly surprise the reader. In telling the story of the Valances, Hollinghurst casts a clear eye on the ways that each new generation tries to keep the family&#x2019;s secrets buried &#x2013; and reminds us that outsiders who try to dredge secrets to the surface have their own very mixed reasons for doing so. <br>&nbsp;<br>Reading this book, we are so utterly immersed in its characters&#x2019; lives that their memories come to seem like our own, at once vital and in the process of being lost. And perhaps this is the novel&#x2019;s most extraordinary quality: the way it gives us events as they happen, and then shows them being transformed in the memory, and transformed again as they are documented, for good and ill. <b>The Stranger&#x2019;s Child</b> is an astonishingly sensitive and perceptive novel, and one that will itself surely be read for generations to come.</p></p><p>Alan Hollinghurst is the author of <b>The Swimming-Pool Library</b>, <b>The Folding Star</b>, <b>The Spell </b>and the Man Booker Prize&#x2013;winning, NBCC Award finalist <b>The Line of Beauty</b>.

He lives in London.She&#x2019;d been lying in the hammock reading poetry for over an hour. It wasn&#x2019;t easy: she was thinking all the while about George coming back with Cecil, and she kept sliding down, in small half-willing surrenders, till she was in a heap, with the book held tiringly above her face. Now the light was going, and the words began to hide among themselves on the page. She wanted to get a look at Cecil, to drink him in for a minute before he saw her, and was introduced, and asked her what she was reading.<br>&nbsp;<br>But he must have missed his train, or at least his connection: she saw him pacing the long platform at Harrow and Wealdstone, and rather regretting he&#x2019;d come. Five minutes later, as the sunset sky turned pink above the rockery, it began to seem possible that something worse had happened. With sudden grave excitement she pictured the arrival of a telegram, and the news being passed round; imagined weeping pretty wildly; then saw herself describing the occasion to someone, many years later, though still without quite deciding what the news had been. In the sitting-room the lamps were being lit, and through the open window she could hear her mother talking to Mrs. Kalbeck, who had come to tea, and who tended to stay, having no one to get back for. The glow across the path made the garden suddenly lonelier. Daphne slipped out of the hammock, put on her shoes, and forgot about her books. She started towards the house, but something in the time of day held her, with its hint of a mystery she had so far overlooked: it drew her down the lawn, past the rockery, where the pond that reflected the trees in silhouette had grown as deep as the white sky. It was the long still moment when the hedges and borders turned dusky and vague, but anything she looked at closely, a rose, a begonia, a glossy laurel leaf, seemed to give itself back to the day with a secret throb of colour.<br>&nbsp;<br>She heard a faint familiar sound, the knock of the broken gate against the post at the bottom of the garden; and then an unfamiliar voice, with an edge to it, and then George&#x2019;s laugh. He must have brought Cecil the other way, through the Priory and the woods. Daphne ran up the narrow half-hidden steps in the rockery and from the top she could just make them out in the spinney below. She couldn&#x2019;t really hear what they were saying, but she was disconcerted by Cecil&#x2019;s voice; it seemed so quickly and decisively to take control of their garden and their house and the whole of the coming weekend. It was an excitable voice that seemed to say it didn&#x2019;t care who heard it, but in its tone there was also something mocking and superior. She looked back at the house, the dark mass of the roof and the chimney-stacks against the sky, the lamp-lit windows under low eaves, and thought about Monday, and the life they would pick up again very readily after Cecil had gone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Under the trees the dusk was deeper, and their little wood seemed interestingly larger. The boys were dawdling, for all Cecil&#x2019;s note of impatience. Their pale clothes, the rim of George&#x2019;s boater, caught the failing light as they moved slowly between the birch-trunks, but their faces were hard to make out. George had stopped and was poking at something with his foot, Cecil, taller, standing close beside him, as if to share his view of it. She went cautiously towards them, and it took her a moment to realize that they were quite unaware of her; she stood still, smiling awkwardly, let out an anxious gasp, and then, mystified and excited, began to explore her position. She knew that Cecil was a guest and too grown-up to play a trick on, though George was surely in her power. But having the power, she couldn&#x2019;t think what to do with it. Now Cecil had his hand on George&#x2019;s shoulder, as if consoling him, though he was laughing too, more quietly than before; the curves of their two hats nudged and overlapped. She thought there was something nice in Cecil&#x2019;s laugh, after all, a little whinny of good fun, even if, as so often, she was not included in the joke. Then Cecil raised his head and saw her and said, &#x201c;Oh, hello!&#x201d; as if they&#x2019;d already met several times and enjoyed it.<br>&nbsp;<br>George was confused for a second, peered at her as he quickly buttoned his jacket, and said, &#x201c;Cecil missed his train,&#x201d; rather sharply.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, clearly,&#x201d; said Daphne, who chose a certain dryness of tone against the constant queasy likelihood of being teased.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And then of course I had to see Middlesex,&#x201d; said Cecil, coming forward and shaking her hand. &#x201c;We seem to have tramped over much of the county.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He brought you the country way,&#x201d; said Daphne. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the country way, and the suburban way, which doesn&#x2019;t create such a fine impression. You just go straight up Stanmore Hill.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>George wheezed with embarrassment, and also a kind of relief. &#x201c;There, Cess, you&#x2019;ve met my sister.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Cecil&#x2019;s hand, hot and hard, was still gripping hers, in a frank, convivial way. It was a large hand, and somehow unfeeling; a hand more used to gripping oars and ropes than the slender fingers of sixteen-yearold girls. She took in his smell, of sweat and grass, the sourness of his breath. When she started to pull her fingers out, he squeezed again, for a second or two, before releasing her. She didn&#x2019;t like the sensation, but in the minute that followed she found that her hand held the memory of his hand, and half-wanted to reach out through the shadows and touch it again.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I was reading poetry,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m afraid it grew too dark to see.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; said Cecil, with his quick high laugh, that was almost a snigger; but she sensed he was looking at her kindly. In the late dusk they had to peer closely to be sure of each other&#x2019;s expressions; it made them seem particularly interested in each other. &#x201c;Which poet?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She had Tennyson&#x2019;s poems, and also the <i>Granta, </i>with three of Cecil&#x2019;s own poems in it, &#x201c;Corley,&#x201d; &#x201c;Dawn at Corley&#x201d; and &#x201c;Corley: Dusk.&#x201d; She said, &#x201c;Oh, Alfred, Lord Tennyson.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Cecil nodded slowly and seemed amused by searching for the kind and lively thing to say. &#x201c;Do you find he still holds up?&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh yes,&#x201d; said Daphne firmly, and then wondered if she&#x2019;d understood the question. She glanced between the lines of trees, but with a sense of other shadowy perspectives, the kind of Cambridge talk that George often treated them to, where things were insisted on that couldn&#x2019;t possibly be meant. It was a refinement of teasing, where you were never told why your answer was wrong. &#x201c;We all love Tennyson here,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;at &#x2018;Two Acres.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Now Cecil&#x2019;s eyes seemed very playful, under the broad peak of his cap. &#x201c;Then I can see we shall get on,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s all read out our favourite poems&#x2014;if you like to read aloud.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh yes!&#x201d; said Daphne, excited already, though she&#x2019;d never heard Hubert read out anything except a letter in <i>The Times </i>that he agreed with. &#x201c;Which <i>is </i>your favourite?&#x201d; she said, with a moment&#x2019;s worry that she wouldn&#x2019;t have heard of it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cecil smiled at them both, savouring his power of choice, and said, &#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;ll find out when I read it to you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s not &#x2018;The Lady of Shalott,&#x2019; &#x201d; said Daphne.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I like &#x2018;The Lady of Shalott.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I mean, that&#x2019;s my favourite,&#x201d; said Daphne.<br>&nbsp;<br>George said, &#x201c;Well, come up and meet Mother,&#x201d; spreading his arms to shepherd them.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And Mrs. Kalbeck&#x2019;s here too,&#x201d; said Daphne, &#x201c;by the way.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Then we&#x2019;ll try and get rid of her,&#x201d; said George.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, you can try . . . ,&#x201d; said Daphne.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m already feeling sorry for Mrs. Kalbeck,&#x201d; said Cecil, &#x201c;whoever she may be.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a big black beetle,&#x201d; said George, &#x201c;who took Mother to Germany last year, and hasn&#x2019;t let go of her since.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a German widow,&#x201d; said Daphne, with a note of sad realism and a pitying shake of the head. She found Cecil had spread his arms too and, hardly thinking, she did the same; for a moment they seemed united in a lightly rebellious pact.</p><h2>Isamu Noguchi : The Life of a Sculptor (Illustrated with photographs)</h2><p>A brief biography of the renowned Japanese-American sculptor.</p><p></p><h2>The Winter Sea</h2><p>Used.

There wasn't any part of it that happened just by chance.</p> <p>I learned this later; though the realization, when it came, was hard for me to grasp because I'd always had a firm belief in self-determination. My life so far had seemed to bear this out-I'd chosen certain paths and they had led to certain ends, all good, and any minor bumps that I had met along the way I could accept as not bad luck, but simply products of my own imperfect judgment. If I'd had to choose a creed, it would have been the poet William Henley's bravely ringing lines: <i>I am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul. </i>So on that winter morning when it all began, when I first took my rental car and headed north from Aberdeen, it never once occurred to me that someone else's hand was at the helm.</p> <p>I honestly believed it was my own decision, turning off the main road for the smaller one that ran along the coastline. Not the wisest of decisions, maybe, seeing as the roads were edged with what I'd been assured was Scotland's deepest snow in forty years, and I'd been warned I might run into drifting and delays. Caution and the knowledge I was running on a schedule should have kept me to the more well-traveled highway, but the small sign that said 'Coastal Route' diverted me.</p> <p>My father always told me that the sea was in my blood. I had been born and raised beside it on the shores of Nova Scotia, and I never could resist its siren pull. So when the main road out of Aberdeen turned inland I turned right instead, and took the way along the coast.</p> <p>I couldn't say how far away I was when I first saw the ruined castle on the cliffs, a line of jagged darkness set against a cloud-filled sky, but from the moment I first saw it I was captivated, driving slightly faster in the hope I'd reach it sooner, paying no attention to the clustered houses I was driving past, and feeling disappointment when the road curved sharply off again, away from it. But then, beyond the tangle of a wood, the road curved back again, and there it was: a long dark ruin, sharp against the snowbound fields that stretched forbiddingly between the cliff 's edge and the road. I saw a parking lot ahead, a little level place with logs to mark the spaces for the cars, and on an impulse I pulled in and stopped.</p> <p>The lot was empty. Not surprising, since it wasn't even noon yet, and the day was cold and windy, and there wasn't any reason anyone would stop out here unless they wanted to walk out to see the ruin. And from looking at the only path that I could see that led to it-a frozen farm lane drifted deep with snow that would have risen past my knees-I guessed there wouldn't be too many people stopping here today. I knew I shouldn't stop, myself. There wasn't time. I had to be in Peterhead by one o'clock. But something in me felt a sudden need to know exactly where I was, and so I reached to check my map.</p> <p>I'd spent the past five months in France; I'd bought my map there, and it had its limitations, being more concerned with roads and highways than with towns and ruins. I was looking so hard at the squiggle of coastline and trying to make out the names in fine print that I didn't see the man till he'd gone past me, walking slowly, hands in pockets, with a muddy-footed spaniel at his heels.</p> <p>It seemed a strange place for a man on foot to be, out here. The road was busy and the snow along the banks left little room to walk beside it, but I didn't question his appearance. Any time I had a choice between a living, breathing person and a map, I chose the person. So I scrambled, map in hand, and got my car door open, but the salt wind blowing off the sea across the fields was stronger than I'd thought it would be. It stole my voice. I had to try again. 'Excuse me...'</p> <p>I believe the spaniel heard me first. It turned, and then the man turned too, and seeing me, retraced his steps. He was a younger man than I'd expected, not much older than myself-mid-thirties, maybe, with dark hair whipped roughly by the wind and a close-trimmed dark beard that made him look a little like a pirate. His walk, too, had a swagger to it, confident. He asked me, 'Can I help you?'</p> <p>'Can you show me where I am?' I held the map towards him.</p> <p>Coming round to block the wind, he stood beside me, head bent to the printed coastline. 'Here,' he said, and pointed to a nameless headland. 'Cruden Bay. Where are ye meant to be?' His head turned very slightly as he asked that, and I saw his eyes were not a pirate's eyes. They were clear grey, and friendly, and his voice was friendly too, with all the pleasant, rolling cadence of the northern Scot. </p> <p>I said, 'I'm going north, to Peterhead.'</p> <p>'Well, that's not a problem.' He pointed it out on the map. 'It's not far. You just keep on this road, it'll take you right up into Peterhead.' Close by his knee the dog yawned a complaint, and he sighed and looked down. 'Half a minute.</p> <p>You see that I'm talking?'</p> <p>I smiled. 'What's his name?' </p> <p>'Angus.'</p> <p>Bending, I scratched the dog's hanging ears, spattered with mud. 'Hello, Angus. You've been for a run.'</p> <p>'Aye, he'd run all the day if I'd let him. He's not one for standing still.'</p> <p>Neither, I thought, was his master. The man had an aura of energy, restlessness, and I'd delayed him enough. 'Then I'll let you get going,' I said as I straightened. 'Thank you for your help.' </p> <p>'Nae bother,' he assured me, and he turned and started off again, the spaniel trotting happily ahead.</p> <p>The hardened footpath stretched ahead of them, towards the sea, and at its end I saw the castle ruin standing stark and square and roofless to the swiftly running clouds, and as I looked at it I felt a sudden pulling urge to stay-to leave the car parked where it was and follow man and dog where they had gone, and hear the roaring of the sea around those crumbled walls.</p> <p>But I had promises to keep.</p> <p>So with reluctance, I got back into my rental car, turned the key and started off again towards the north.</p></p><h2>Not Equal: Civil Rights Gone Wrong</h2><p>The Radiance Foundation is the official (and only) seller of new NOT EQUAL: Civil Rights Gone Wrong.

This lavishly illustrated book is the first in any language to explore fully the vanished world of the Russian country estate. Priscilla Roosevelt brings to life these magnificent aristocratic dwellings, discussing their origins, their design and decoration, the social, family, and cultural life within their walls, and their physical demise after the 1917 revolution.<br>The Bolshevik revolution destroyed both the world of the estate and much of the evidence about it. To recreate this lost world Roosevelt has drawn on many sources - including the physical remains of once-grand manor houses (many photographed for this book), the invaluable diaries and memoirs that chronicle a way of life that was to perish, and the Russian art and literature that estate life produced and in which it was portrayed. Juxtaposing images from art and from the novels of such literary giants as Turgenev and Tolstoy with the real milieu that inspired them, the book is a beautiful and vivid portrait of Russian country life.</p><p>Priscilla Roosevelt is a fellow of the Institute for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies, George Washington University.The Russia of the old regime was an overwhelmingly rural society even at the dawn of the twentieth century. Like the plantation owners of our antebellum South, the landed aristocrats of Russia saw themselves as the standard-bearers and protectors of their national culture and "gentlemanly values." Even after the end of legal serfdom in 1861, these large islands of wealth continued to dominate rural Russian life. In her richly detailed and lavishly illustrated work, Roosevelt portrays the strengths, weaknesses, and contradictions of this society. It was an intensely patriarchal society in which oriental elements often seemed to outweigh Western traditions. Surprisingly, these manors, supposedly anchors of conservatism, often generated movements for political reform. From both a historical and a sociological standpoint, Roosevelt has done a fine job of showing us the values, rhythms, and achievements of a vanished world. <i>Jay Freeman</i></p><h2>For the Soul of the People: Protestant Protest Against Hitler</h2><p>Based on interviews with more than sixty German Protestants active in the Confessing Church, a thoughtful examination of this splinter group from the Nazi-controlled Protestant Church reveals the extent of Nazi anti-Christian persecution.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Victoria Barnett</strong> is a graduate of Union Theological Seminary, New York, and a professional writer whose articles have appeared in <em>Christianity and Crisis</em>, <em>The Christian Century</em>, <em>The Witness</em>, and the news bulletins of <em>Religious News Service</em>.

Who hasn&#x2019;t felt the pride of thinking of just the right gift, only to find out that someone else has thought of a better one? Who hasn&#x2019;t had to learn the hard way that the greatest gift of all is friendship? This is the lesson the nine animals are about to learn as they make their way to the palace to celebrate the raja-king&#x2019;s birthday. Why nine animals? And why the well? Because James Rumford&#x2019;s original fable is also a counting book, where we learn that our ten Arabic numerals came not from Arabia, as one might think, but from India.<br>With its pictures of paper collage reminiscent of the glorious designs on the walls of the Taj Mahal, Nine Animals and the Well will teach, amuse, and delight.</p><p>Master storyteller James Rumford combines his love for art and history in his picture books. Each of his books is vastly different in its content, design, and illustrations but one aspect remains constant throughout his work: his passion about his subjects. Rumford, a resident of Hawaii, has studied more than a dozen languages and worked in the Peace Corps, where he traveled to Africa, Asia, and Afghanistan. He draws from these experiences and the history of his subject when he is working on a book. His book Sequoyah: The Cherokee Man Who Gave His People Writing was a 2005 Sibert Honor winner.Kindergarten-Grade 3-Nine animals are on their way to the raja-king's birthday party and each guest wants to bring the perfect gift. Monkey is proud of his "cloudlike loaf of bread" until he meets Rhino, who scoffs at it, and Monkey, suddenly ashamed, throws it into the river. As the journey continues, each animal feels its own offering is small and inappropriate compared to the next-Camel brings three almond cakes, Rabbit brings four sugar cones, Cow brings five lotus flowers, etc.-and throws it away in embarrassment and humiliation. The lines of text follow the trail of the discarded presents and the creatures that enjoy them. When Peacock carelessly flaunts his nine gold coins, the pouch opens and the contents fall into a well. The guests arrive at the palace empty-handed, but are reassured by their host that their offering of friendship and the retelling of the story of "the well that swallowed their pride" are the best presents. The rich, jewel-toned illustrations are framed by European, North African, Arabic, and Indian numerals on the side and are placed on handmade Indian paper decorated with flowers. An endnote explains how the numbers we use originated in India. A captivating fable and an effective counting book.<br><i>Linda Ludke, London Public Library, Ontario, Canada</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Story, NiV: The Bible As One Continuing Story of God and His People (Southeast Christian 50th Anniversary Edition)</h2><p>&#39;THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD&#39; IS MORE THAN JUST A CLICHe.

Smart, witty and extremely sexy, this second volume of Sex Chronicles is tailored to women -- but perfect for lovers to share.</p></p><p><b>Zane</b> is the author of <i>The Heat Seekers, Addicted, The Sex Chronicles,</i> and <i>Shame on It All.</i> She lives in the Washington, D.C. area.<p><b>When Opposites Attract</b> </p><p> "You have an eight-thirty meeting with the board of directors about the five-percent projected increase in the fiscal budget, a ten o'clock meeting with the legal team about the impending lawsuit from the Grayson Corporation, a lunch meeting with Ronald Jackson about his transfer to the Hong Kong office, and a three o'clock conference call with the regional managers from Los Angeles, Dallas, and Atlanta." </p><p> I could hear my secretary, Shelly, running off my daily schedule, but I was looking past her out of the floor-to-ceiling window. She had greeted me at the door, mug of steaming coffee in her hand, two creams, one sugar, just like she did every morning. She was a pretty sistah -- tall, graceful, beautiful skin, perfect smile -- but she always seemed so stressed out. I often wondered why she let her executive assistant job get to her so much. Granted, I was stressed out all the time as well, but I had more to lose. Unlike me, Shelly earned no more than $889.95 after taxes, every two weeks, no matter what her work performance. </p><p> I glanced up at her, standing rigidly like she was preparing for a military drill. "Shelly, can I ask you a personal question?" </p><p> A nervous expression shadowed her face, causing me to wonder if she was afraid of me. We were the exact same age but had never bonded. I was the vice president of corporate development, pulling down 250K a year plus bonuses. She had barely finished high school. </p><p> "Sure. Go ahead," she finally responded. </p><p> "Do you ever just go out and have a good time?" I redirected my eyes to the window. There was not a cloud in the powder blue sky. "I mean, just let it all go, hang out with friends, party hearty?" </p><p> She giggled. She was gleaming at the mere thought of it. "My friends and I all go to this club over in Brooklyn every Friday night for happy hour, and sometimes we go to a reggae club on Saturdays." </p><p> "Reggae, huh?" It was my turn to giggle. "I can't even imagine you dancing to reggae music." </p><p> Shelly sat down facing me in one of the leather wing chairs across from my desk. I couldn't remember the last time she had actually taken a seat, other than to take dictation. I was pleased. It felt comfortable, like two sistahs shooting the breeze. </p><p> "What about you, Maylia? I mean, Ms. Kincaid." </p><p> "Maylia is fine," I responded. "You don't have to be so formal all the time." </p><p> "Thank you." </p><p> I didn't know whether to be flattered or offended by her thank you. Did she think I was so high-falutin' she had to show appreciation for calling me by my first name? </p><p> "So, what about you, Maylia? Do you ever just hang out?" </p><p> I pondered her question. I wasn't sure that attending business dinners with clients or boring social engagements at the country club with my parents constituted hanging out. </p><p> "Shelly, to be honest, I really don't know," I answered. "I go a lot of places, the finest restaurants and theaters in New York, but I can't remember the last time I actually had fun." </p><p> I gazed deep into her eyes and recognized something I hated: pity. I was pitiful. I needed to face facts. All the money, power, and security that I had in my life meant nothing unless I was enjoying the ride. </p><p> My parents had groomed me to take my place in high society, pure and simple. My father made his millions in international trade while my mother spent her days shopping in Macy's, Saks, and various boutiques on Fifth Avenue. I went to school at Yale University, graduated with honors, and nabbed a job with McMillan and Associates before I could even move out of my dorm good. </p><p> There I was, in my corner office on Fifty-ninth Street overlooking Central Park South, wondering what the hell I was doing with my life. Shelly did not have much money, but she had freedom. She could leave the office at five o'clock and do whatever she wished. I had to play negotiator over soft-shell crabs or spend my nights going over stacks of reports. I truly envied her. </p><p> I jumped up from my desk, startling Shelly. She jumped up too and waited for my instructions, assuming her military position again. </p><p> "I'm going out," I announced. </p><p> "Out? What about your meeting?" </p><p> "Cancel it!" I walked toward my private bath, grabbing my purse off my desk on the way. "In fact, cancel all of my appointments. I'm taking the day off!" </p><p> "But, but, but Ms. Kincaid, I mean Maylia," she stuttered, "what am I supposed to tell everybody?" </p><p> "Tell them I'm sick or something." I swung around to face her. "Isn't that what people usually say when they play hooky from school or work?" </p><p> Shelly shrugged her shoulders. "I guess." </p><p> I was about to close the bathroom door in her face when a lightbulb went off in my head. "Shelly, after you cancel all of my engagements, take the day off as well." </p><p> "Are you serious?" She put her hands on her hips, striking a sistahgurl pose. I fell out laughing. She looked good like that. </p><p> I put my purse on the vanity counter and struck the same pose. "Yeah, gurl, I'm serious!" I exclaimed in my best ghettoized accent. </p><p> "Well, <i>aiight</i> then." She giggled, enjoying our little scene. </p><p> I walked back out of the bathroom and raised my left palm. "Give me five!" </p><p> She slapped me a high five and laughed so hard that she was practically crying. "I guess I'll see you tomorrow, then?" </p><p> "Maybe. Maybe not," I chided, knowing good and well taking two days off in a row would be pushing it. They'd probably send the police to my penthouse to make sure I was still breathing. </p><p> Shelly strutted out of my office with more pep in her step than I had ever seen and closed the door. I went back in the bathroom and gazed in the mirror. Now, I was glowing. I felt so, so, so invigorated. The mere thought of actually shucking my responsibilities for an entire day was thrilling. </p><p> I took a good look at myself and decided I appeared to be more like fifty than my actual thirty years. My hair and makeup, not to mention the stuffy, conservative suit, put age on me. I pulled the clip out of my ebony hair and let it fall down across my shoulders. It had been so long since I physically and symbolically let my hair down. </p><p> I took off the blazer of my Donna Karan suit, unbuttoned my sleeves, and rolled them up to just below my elbows. I looked younger already. I turned to the side so I could see the profile of my body. My breasts were as pert as ever, and my ass was just as firm and round as it was in college. Too bad I didn't show off my assets more often. </p><p> I had no idea where I was going to go or what I was going to do today, but I was determined to savor and enjoy it. Then I thought about the park. Every day, I looked down from the twenty-fourth floor at the ant-size people Rollerblading, strolling, or riding bikes through Central Park. I didn't know the first thing about Rollerblading, and I hadn't been on a bike since my first year in high school, but I did know how to stroll. </p><p> The three-inch leather pumps I had on were not made for walking, though, so I dug through my closet behind the bathroom door and retrieved my gym bag. The same workout clothes had been in it for more than three years. I had every intention of hitting the corporate gym on the seventh floor -- I really did -- but time constraints just never allowed it. </p><p> I opted out of changing clothes completely, but I did take off my thigh-high stockings so I could put on my white crew socks and cross trainers. I had often laughed at the women walking down the street or catching the train in work clothes and tennis shoes. It looked so silly. But I was content to look silly for just one day. </p><p> When I emerged from my office less than five minutes later, Shelly was nowhere in sight. Her phone console had been forwarded to the night message, and all the papers I had seen strewn across her desk when I came in were neatly stacked in her in box. Girlfriend meant business about her day off. Now it was my turn to escape the madness. </p><p><br> I managed to get down to ground level in the elevator before someone began to question me. The security guard, Fred, wanted to know if I needed him to call a company car. I told him no thanks, that I would be taking a morning walk in the park. He looked at me in stunned disbelief. I left him sitting there at the security desk with his mouth wide open and swiveled through the revolving door into the brisk morning air. </p><p> I sucked air into my lungs, and it felt wonderful. I went to the corner and waited for the light to change before crossing the street and entering Central Park. People were laughing and enjoying themselves. They had lives, unlike me. </p><p> I walked down a path for a long time. The muscles in the back of my calves began aching, and I realized I needed to start working out. Not because of weight issues -- I was only carrying about 133 pounds on my five-six frame -- I was just out of shape, <i>period.</i> </p><p> I spotted an ice cream vendor and grew excited. I had not had an ice cream cone in years; just fancy desserts like biscotti, compote, and slices of cheesecake that cost more than having a pizza delivered. I half-ran over to the vendor and whipped out a five, asking for a double scoop of chocolate on a waffle cone. I licked my lips while he hand-packed the ice cream onto the cone. I paid him and then turned around just as a big-ass basketball appeared from nowhere and knocked the cone into me. Luckily, the ice cream was so hard that I only ended up with a brown circle over my left breast, but I was still pissed. My ice cream was on the ground. <i>What idiot would be so careless?</i> </p><p> I glanced up and saw the idiot coming toward me. I wanted to spew out a bunch of ugly words at him, but I could not. I was reared up better than that, and people do make mistakes. He was average-looking and I envisioned what type of woman would date him. Certainly not me. </p><p> He frowned. "I'm sorry. Did you get hurt?" </p><p> "No, I'm fine." I smiled at him and pointed to my shirt. "Just a little stain." </p><p> "Well, let me buy you another cone. That's the least I could do." He picked up the cone from the ground and tossed it into the nearest receptacle. "You should let me pay to have your shirt cleaned also." </p><p> "None of that is necessary. Really." </p><p> He wasn't paying attention. He was already digging into the pockets of his athletic shorts, searching for money. He paid the vendor for another cone. </p><p> "Thank you," I said as he handed it to me. </p><p> "You're welcome." He glanced back over to the basketball court, where three other men were standing, looking mighty impatient. "I better get back to the game. Have a nice day." </p><p> "You, too." </p><p> I decided that my best strategy was to find a bench and eat my cone. I did not want to risk someone bumping into me while I was walking and causing another mess. There was a bench on a hill about thirty feet from the basketball court, so I grabbed it seconds before a man in a suit with a bag lunch got to it. </p><p> I was sitting there, licking the hell out of my ice cream cone, when I started surveying the rest of the men on the court. One of them stood out from the rest. Not just because of his height, though he had to be at least six-five -- he stood out because he was the finest man I had seen in ages. Sepia skin, ebony eyes, and some seriously lickable lips. None of them had on a shirt, but his muscles put the rest of theirs to shame. </p><p> "Damn!" I heard myself exclaim out of lust. </p><p> Before I finished my cone, I was in heat. The ice cream did nothing to cool me down. I was sitting there fantasizing about that man's hands, tongue, and whatever else all over me. Once I finished my cone, I did not budge. I was mesmerized. How foolish, I finally said to myself. This is so unlike you, Maylia. </p><p> That may have been true. In fact, it was completely unlike me, but that did not keep me from following the brother when he threw his shirt back on and started walking away. </p><p> I had no idea what I hoped to accomplish by following him, but I kept my distance. I was sure he had absolutely no idea that I was trailing him until... </p><p> "Why don't you just walk beside me?" </p><p> Was he talking to me? Unfortunately, he was. He had stopped dead in his tracks and turned around, staring down at me. </p><p> "Excuse me?" was the only response I could come up with. </p><p> "I said, why don't you just walk beside me?" </p><p> "Why would I want to do that?" I asked, feigning innocence. </p><p> "It's better than following me." He grinned. "You are following me, right?" </p><p> "Don't be absurd!" I could not believe his nerve. Even if he was right about me following him, he did not need to point it out. "What are you, some sort of narcissist or something?" </p><p> "I have no idea what that means." </p><p> "A person who's egotistical, full of themselves." </p><p> "Now, I do know what that means, but I'm not that." He pushed a loose hair away from my face and I felt faint. He was turning me on so much that it was scary. "I am flattered, though." </p><p> "I can't imagine why," I replied, determined to keep some composure. </p><p> "I saw the way you were checking a brotha out on the court." </p><p> "Oh, were you just playing basketball back there?" I asked the question with a straight face. "I wasn't paying attention. I was too busy eating my ice cream cone." </p><p> "The way you ate it was a treat in itself." He licked his lips. I wanted to lick them for him. "It made me wonder if you devour everything else like that." </p><p> "You're nasty." </p><p> He came a step closer, and I could smell his sweat. Even that was turning me on. "And you're fine." </p><p> "I'm also well-bred. I don't tolerate men speaking to me in such a fashion." That much was true. I was not used to men addressing me like that. The majority of the men I had dealt with felt like they had to impress my parents first, so they always went out of their way to be completely proper. That was why my sex life had been so drab. "I only hold conversations with gentlemen." </p><p> I could tell by the way his eyes narrowed that he was offended. "Then why don't you converse your ass back in the opposite direction?" </p><p> "This is a free country." I stepped around him and started walking. "I can go wherever I please and do whatever I want." </p><p> He grabbed my arm and swung me around. "What do you want to do right now?" </p><p> "For starters, I'd like for you to let go of my arm." I tried to free my arm, but he overpowered me. </p><p> He started walking, pulling me along with him. "Come on, let's go." </p><p> "Let's go where?" I asked out of curiosity. I was being accosted in Central Park, and instead of screaming for help, I was asking questions. Bad sign. </p><p> "My place, of course. It's not that far. Unless you'd prefer me to sex you down right here in the park." </p><p> His place? "You're a lunatic!" I lashed out at him. </p><p> "And you're fine." </p><p> I could not help but blush. After all, that was the second time he had called me fine. </p><p> He stopped walking, let my arm go, and eyed me seductively. "I bet you wear nothing but the finest, sexiest lingerie. Probably silk or satin thongs and lacy, revealing bras." He crossed his arms and cu...</p></p><h2>Sailor Moon, Vol. 4</h2><p>Offers the continuing adventures of Serena and her friends, who use the power of the moon and the planets, as the superhero Sailor Moon and her comrades, to battle the forces of evil.</p><p></p><h2>Payback with Ya Life</h2><p>Still recovering from the suicide of her best friend, Shan now pregnant by a married man is forced to make major decisions in her life.

For one thing, it's bigger than all of them (except Alaska). For another, it's got so many different types of land in it that it seems like at least four states in one--mountains, gently sloping plains, three mighty rivers (and many lesser ones), prairies, wetlands, islands, not to mention miles and miles of highways passing through farm country and vast cities. And then there's the weather. It rains a lot in the eastern and central part but hardly at all in the west. Snow and sleet are unusual, but there can be blizzards on the Great Plains and in the Panhandle. There are also parts of Texas that experience droughts and other parts that are prone to flooding. Texas weather can include dust storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and even "blue northers' that blow through, breaking tree limbs, shaking the windows, and lowering the temperature as much as 24 degrees in one hour.<br> It should come as no surprise that a state so full of variety has a history as distinct and unpredictable as its weather and geography. In 9200 B.C. the first humans migrated into the Texas Panhandle. What followed--exploration and settlement by the Spaniards, Mexican rule, the years as an independent republic, statehood, secession, and the Civil War--and what is still unfolding today are fascinating stories. Distinguished Texas historian David G. McComb has gathered anecdotes, tall tales, and little-known facts to bring to life the drama, humor, and far-reaching consequences of Texas history. He writes of the Native Americans in Texas, of the armadillo (a whimsical folk symbol but not, as most suppose, the official state animal), the Alamo, barbed wire, longhorn cattle, the Texas Rangers, and the supreme importance of football to the average Texan. He profiles such Texans as Jim Bowie, Audie Murphy, Van Cliburn, Willie Nelson, Barbara Jordan, Michael DeBakey, and many others who have left a mark not only on Texas but on the world. The long and complex history of Texas falls into place in an entertaining text, brimming with facts and filled with fascinating photographs and illustrations from the past and present.<br>It is safe to say that the United States could not survive without Texas if it had to. But after reading <em>Texas: An Illustrated History</em>, you will agree that Texas, has, over the years, added much to the history of our country and that is has a special brand of humor and style that enriches us all.</p><p><br><strong>David G. McComb</strong> is a displaced Texan currently living in Colorado, where he is professor of history at Colorado State University. He grew up in Houston and graduated from Southern Methodist University. He holds an M.B.A. from Stanford University, an M.A. from Rice University, and a Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin. Professor McComb is the author of <em>Texas: A Modern History</em>; <em>Houston: The Bayou City</em> (winner of the Tullis Prize of the Texas State Historical Association); <em>Galveston: A History</em> (winner of the Texas State Historical Commission Book Award); and <em>Colorado: A History of the</em> <em>Centennial State</em>.

It gives moral legitimacy to the state. It makes limited forms of dissent and incremental change possible. The liberal class posits itself as the conscience of the nation. It permits us, through its appeal to public virtues and the public good, to define ourselves as a good and noble people. Most importantly, on behalf of the power elite the liberal class serves as bulwarks against radical movements by offering a safety valve for popular frustrations and discontentment by discrediting those who talk of profound structural change. Once this class loses its social and political role then the delicate fabric of a democracy breaks down and the liberal class, along with the values it espouses, becomes an object of ridicule and hatred. The door that has been opened to proto-fascists has been opened by a bankrupt liberalism<br><br><b>The Death of the Liberal Class</b> examines the failure of the liberal class to confront the rise of the corporate state and the consequences of a liberalism that has become profoundly bankrupted. Hedges argues there are five pillars of the liberal establishment &#x2014; the press, liberal religious institutions, labor unions, universities and the Democratic Party&nbsp;&#x2014; and that each of these institutions, more concerned with status and privilege than justice and progress, sold out the constituents they represented. In doing so, the liberal class has become irrelevant to society at large and ultimately the corporate power elite they once served.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Chris Hedges, currently a senior fellow at The Nation Institute, a Lecturer in the Council of the Humanities and the Anschutz Distinguished Fellow at Princeton University, spent nearly two decades as a foreign correspondent in Central America, the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans.

A large American flag is strapped to the side of his green backpack. There is a light drizzle and he is wearing a green Army poncho. Short, muscular, and affable, with his brown hair in a close military crop, Bell tells me when I stop my car that he is on a six-day, ninety-mile, self-styled &#x201c;Liberty Walk&#x201d; from Binghamton to Utica. He plans to mount a quixotic campaign to challenge Democratic incumbent Rep. Michael Arcuri in the 24th Congressional District as the Republican candidate. Bell has camped out along the road for three nights and stayed in cheap motels the other nights. He opposes the health-care bill recently passed by the Democratic-majority Congress, calls for an end to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, advocates the abolishment of the Federal Reserve, is against the Federal Government&#x2019;s Wall Street bailouts, and wants to see immediate government relief for workers, including himself, trapped in prolonged unemployment. He carries a handwritten sign: &#x201c;End the Fed,&#x201d; echoing the title of a book by U.S. Representative Ron Paul he keeps in his backpack, along with a copy of <i>U.S. Constitution for Dummies </i>by Michael Arnheim. He says he plans to deliver Paul&#x2019;s book to Arcuri&#x2019;s office in Utica.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I just walked through the town of Norwich,&#x201d; he says as a car passes and the driver honks in support, &#x201c;and there is a strong Tea Party movement there&#x201d;:<br>&nbsp;<br>The Tea Party movement, for the most part, is just a bunch of disgruntled<br>Americans. They know something is wrong and they are<br>ready to be engaged. A lot of the people in my area who are in the Tea<br>Party are Democrats. People are confused. They are shell-shocked.<br>They don&#x2019;t know what to think. But acting like these problems started<br>January 20 [the date of the presidential inauguration] is absurd. To<br>single out the current president and not the presidents before him is<br>not productive for trying to figure out what is going on.2<br>&nbsp;<br>Bell, who lives in Lansing, New York, is the new face of resistance. He is young, at home in the culture of the military, deeply suspicious of the Federal Government, dismissive of the liberal class, unable to find work, and angry. He swings between right-wing and left-wing populism, expressing admiration for both Paul and U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich, as well as the Tea Party movement. He started out as a supporter of John McCain in the last presidential election but soured on the Arizona senator and the Republican Party&#x2019;s ties to Wall Street. He ended up not voting in that election. He has raised about $1,000 from neighbors and friends for his own campaign. Adept at martial arts, he made it to the semifinals of the 2010 Army National Guard Combative Championship at Fort Benning in Georgia, where, in his last bout, he suffered a broken nose, bruised his opponent&#x2019;s ribs and thighs, and lost in a split decision.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I am truly terrified when I think about our future,&#x201d; he says:<br>&nbsp;<br>I believe all signs point to a real systemic economic collapse in the<br>near future, maybe even before the midterm elections. I believe this is<br>why many incumbents are stepping down. They seem to know what<br>is coming and of course the rats are jumping ship and taking their<br>pensions with them. There will be nothing the government or the Fed<br>can do to slow the pain, no more tricks in the bag. I assure you it&#x2019;s<br>going to hurt everyone, except of course, the corporate and banking<br>elite. I say let the empire collapse; sometimes we must die to be<br>reborn. The political system as it stands offers little hope for influencing<br>real change or social justice. I propose we attempt to reverse this<br>coup d&#x2019;�tat by attempting a coup of our own. First, we must try to<br>retake the traditional means of control, power and discourse by<br>restoring integrity to our sold-out democratic election system. Unfortunately,<br>this will probably do little good but it is a worthy effort. It is<br>our patriotic duty to resist tyranny. We must break these chains of<br>oppression and restore our government to principles based on liberty<br>and justice for all. I am not confident that standing outside buildings<br>with signs is going to provide any fundamental power shifts, as power<br>is not often transferred without a struggle. Inalienable rights are not a<br>courtesy of the Federal Government. We must stand in the streets and<br>refuse to be silenced. We must reject corporate-controlled politics<br>and focus on rebuilding a localized political structure and society. A<br>revolution is the only alternative to complete surrender and defeat.<br>Cold, hard suffering and pain will be the only hope for a real revolution,<br>and this is all but guaranteed. At this point protest must be<br>transformed into acts of defiance. We must be bold.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bell grew up in Oakwood, a small town in East Texas between Dallas and Houston. His father struggled with alcoholism and is now in recovery. His parents, who frequently fought, separated, and reunited, divorced when Bell was thirteen. His mother was left to raise Bell, along with his younger brother (currently in the Army&#x2019;s 82nd Airborne Division) and his younger sister in a one-bedroom apartment. There was little money, and his mother worked sporadically at odd jobs. There were eighteen people in his high-school graduating class. With few jobs in Oakwood, Bell, along with several of his classmates, joined the military.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;My father worked two jobs to support us; he suffered from the disease of alcoholism but is a good guy and tried to be supportive father,&#x201d; Bell says:<br>&nbsp;<br>My mom had her own set of problems. She is now living in a oneroom<br>shack. She had breast cancer four years ago and has no insurance<br>and is living in poverty. I know the system is not working. She<br>lives at the little house, a one-bedroom cabin on her mother&#x2019;s land,<br>where me and my brother lived off and on when my parents were<br>arguing. We lived in several different houses and apartments with<br>both my mom and dad. I left home when I was seventeen, drifting<br>between friends&#x2019; houses, then moved back to Oakwood, where I finished<br>high school, living with my grandparents, who had a profound<br>effect on my life and values. My life was inconsistent, chaotic, and<br>working-class. I believe this environment helped develop my character<br>and perspective. I have to give credit where it&#x2019;s due. My dad tried.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t stay in Oakwood, Texas, and have a job,&#x201d; he adds.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bell moved to upstate New York two years ago after leaving the Marine Corps to be near Shianne, his three-year-old daughter. He and the girl&#x2019;s mother are separated. Bell found work as a carpenter with a traveling construction crew. He earned $14.50 an hour and could sometimes make as much as $800 a week. Then the financial meltdown knocked the wind out of the local economy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Everybody in my apartment building has had their hours cut, are unemployed, or have taken minimum-wage jobs,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I was laid off last year. I try to find work as an independent carpenter. I don&#x2019;t have health insurance.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The dearth of work, which left him attempting to survive at times on $600 a month, saw him enlist last year in the New York National Guard, even though it means almost certain deployment to Afghanistan. The enticement of a $20,000 signing bonus was too lucrative to pass up. The National Guard unit he joined recently returned from a tour in Afghanistan.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We are training to go back to Afghanistan,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;The fact that they are still using Army National Guard, state-level troops, to police the streets of Afghanistan is not good. These units are really overstretched. We do not get the benefits. We don&#x2019;t get health insurance like active-duty military. But the guard gets deployed just as much. Some of these guys have been on three and four tours.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I got out of the Marine Corps and went back to Texas for ten months and was involved in the John McCain campaign,&#x201d; he says:<br>&nbsp;<br>I really got disillusioned with the neoconservatism. I had never been<br>involved in politics. The idea that we needed all these troops all around<br>the world &#x201c;defending freedom,&#x201d; as they called it, when we were actually<br>engaged in nation-building and supporting special interests that drive<br>these wars, was something I began to understand. As far as foreign and<br>economic policy, I could see there was no difference between the two<br>main political parties. There is a false left/right paradigm which diverts<br>the working class from the real reasons for their hardships.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The winters [in New York State] are really hard,&#x201d; Bell says:<br>&nbsp;<br>There are less jobs and the heating costs are high. I pay about $200 a<br>month for electric and gas. I live really cheaply. I don&#x2019;t have cable. I<br>don&#x2019;t go out or spend money that is not necessary. It is a struggle. But<br>at least I have not had to devote forty hours a week to a minimumwage<br>job that does not pay me a living wage. People here are really<br>hurting. The real underemployment rate must be at least twenty percent.<br>A lot of people are working part-time jobs when they want fulltime<br>jobs. There are many people like me, independent contractors<br>and small business owners, who can&#x2019;t file for unemployment insurance.<br>Unemployment [coverage] is not available to me because I<br>worked as a 1099, a self-employed contractor, even when I worked for<br>the construction company.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;People are scared,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;They want to live their lives, raise their children, and be happy. This is not possible. They don&#x2019;t know if they can make their next mortgage payment. They see their standard of living going down.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Bell says he and those around him are being pushed off the edge. He says he fears the social and political repercussions.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I hope there is a populist revolution,&#x201d; he says:<br>&nbsp;<br>We have to take the corporate bailouts and the money we are sending<br>overseas and use that money in our communities. If this does not<br>happen there will be more anger and eventually violence. When<br>people lose everything they start to lose it. When you can&#x2019;t find a job,<br>even though you look repeatedly, it leads to things like random<br>shootings and suicides. We will see acts of domestic terrorism. The<br>state will erode more of our civil liberties to control mass protests.<br>We are seeing some student protests, but we will see these on a wider<br>scale. I hope the protests will be constructive. I hope people will not<br>resort to extreme measures. But people will do what they have to do<br>to survive. This may mean things like food riots. The political establishment<br>better work very fast to take the pressure off.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Anger and a sense of betrayal: these are what Ernest Logan Bell and tens of millions of other disenfranchised workers express. These emotions spring from the failure of the liberal class over the past three decades to protect the minimal interests of the working and middle class as corporations dismantled the democratic state, decimated the manufacturing sector, looted the U.S. Treasury, waged imperial wars that can neither be afforded nor won, and gutted the basic laws that protected the interests of ordinary citizens. Yet the liberal class continues to speak in the prim and obsolete language of policies and issues. It refuses to defy the corporate assault. A virulent right wing, for this reason, captures and expresses the legitimate rage articulated by the disenfranchised. And the liberal class has become obsolete even as it clings to its positions of privilege within liberal institutions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Classical liberalism was formulated largely as a response to the dissolution of feudalism and church authoritarianism. It argued for noninterference or independence under the rule of law. It incorporates a few aspects of ancient Athenian philosophy as expressed by Pericles and the Sophists, but was a philosophical system that marked a radical rupture with both Aristotelian thought and medieval theology. Classical liberalism has, the philosopher John Gray writes,<br>&nbsp;<br>four principle features, or perspectives, which give it a recognizable<br>identity: it is individualist, in that it asserts the moral primacy of the<br>person against any collectivity; egalitarian, in that it confers on all<br>human beings the same basic moral status; universalist, affirming the<br>moral unity of the species; and meliorist, in that it asserts the openended<br>improvability, by use of critical reason, of human life.3<br>&nbsp;<br>Thomas Hobbes (1588&#x2013;1679), John Locke (1632&#x2013;1704), and Baruch Spinoza (1632&#x2013;1677) laid the foundations for classical liberalism. The work of these theorists was expanded in the eighteenth century by the Scottish moral philosophers, the French <i>philosophes, </i>and the early architects of American democracy. The philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806&#x2013;1873) redefined liberalism in the nineteenth century to call for the redistribution of wealth and the promotion of the welfare state.<br>&nbsp;<br>The liberal era, which flourished in the later part of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth, was characterized by the growth of mass movements and social reforms that addressed working conditions in factories, the organizing of labor unions, women&#x2019;s rights,universal education, housing for the poor, public health campaigns, and socialism. This liberal era effectively ended with World War I. The war, which shattered liberal optimism about the inevitability of human progress, also consolidated state and corporate control over economic, political, cultural, and social affairs. It created mass culture, fostered through the consumer society the cult of the self, led the nation into an era of permanent war, and used fear and mass propaganda to cow citizens and silence independent and radical voices within the liberal class.

Other than his address and his occupation as a clerk, few details about the boy survive. A few more, though, can be surmised.</p><p></p><p>As he started down the wide avenue, descending from Harlem Heights to the valley at 125th Street, he would have passed through a sloping neighborhood of row houses and low apartment buildings occupied by working-class families. Because today was a holiday, and because the weather was pleasant, some of the families would have been out on the avenue, strolling the bluff above the river. Young children would have turned to watch Terrance glide by on his bicycle, hunched over his handlebars, cap pulled low on his head, wind pulling at the tail of his coat. Perhaps a few flecks of confetti escaped from the furls of his coat and fluttered out behind him like tiny bright moths.</p><p></p><p>Certainly Terrance had gone out to greet the New Year the previous evening. What sixteen-year-old boy could have resisted the tug of the street? He may have joined the swollen tide of revelers on 125th Street, where the festivities had continued, with occasional interruptions from the police, until nearly dawn. Or more likely, being a self-supporting and spirited adolescent -- the kind of go-getter, according to the next day's New York World, who had made a New Year's vow to "take no one's dust when on his bicycle" -- he'd traveled downtown to Forty-second Street to cast himself into that great cauldron of humanity that was Times Square on New Year's Eve.</p><p></p><p>Only a few years earlier, well within Terrance's young memory, New Year's Eve had been a quiet and civilized affair spent at home or on the streets of lower Broadway, where the chimes of Trinity Church rang harmoniously at midnight. These last several years, though, it had metamorphosed into something entirely different -- more like an election night bacchanalia, with a bit of Independence Day bumptiousness thrown in, plus some frantic energy all its own. The chimes still rang at the old church downtown, but the action was uptown now, and its pulsating center was right here at the nonsectarian intersection of Broadway and Forty-second street.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in Times Square, Terrance would have climbed directly into a press of bodies and a blizzard of confetti swirling under the dazzling lights of Broadway. The streets had been filling since early in the evening, tens of thousands of bodies funneling in from Union Square and the Flatiron district, from the Tenderloin, still others from the outer boroughs by streetcar or subway or ferry. "An acrobat could hardly have managed to fall down for a wager, so tightly did the people hold each other up," reported the next day's New York <i>Evening Sun</i>. A special correspondent for the <i>Chicago Daily Tribune</i> judged the noise in Times Square to be more varied than in previous years. "Slide trombones that yowled like a cat in torture, a combination of cowbells and street car gongs, tin horns with a double register, sections of iron pipe that could be rasped with files till they gave forth bellows that carried for blocks," were a few of the sounds the correspondent recorded. Shouts and squeals blended with these other sounds to create, as the <i>New York Tribune</i> put it, a "terrifying reverberation."</p><p></p><p>To step into that crowd was to release all sense of direction and decorum. It moved as an organic, unruly mass, drifting, lulling, then surging spasmodically. A sixteen-year-old boy on the last night of 1907 would have been astonished to find himself squeezed in among so many strangers; or, more to the point, among so many young women. While the usual distaff armor -- overcoats, ankle-length skirts, petticoats, shirtwaists, steel-plated corsets, undergarments -- did its job of keeping feminine flesh secured, the rules of Victorian modesty lapsed that night. Men and women ground against each other indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>At every corner, meanwhile, temptation beckoned in the form of vendor carts stocked high with horns and nickel bags of confetti. Assuming you could get to one of these vendors, you could stick a horn into your mouth and stuff your pockets with confetti, all for a dime, then dash back into the swarm to discharge your colored specks into the face of a stranger. More aggressive boys and men squirmed through the crowd with small feather dusters -- "ticklers," they were called -- brushing the exposed flesh of women's faces and ears, then vanishing before they could be reprimanded or cuffed. Police Commissioner Bingham had issued an edict against the use of ticklers this New Year's Eve but nobody paid him any mind. Many of the women had taken matters into their own hands, covering their faces with heavy veils to ward off the feathers.</p><p></p><p>Near Forty-second Street, a group of enterprising young men pulled a clothesline across the sidewalk, tying one end to an iron post and drawing the other end taut to the curb. When young women approached, they raised the line a foot or two off the pavement. "Leap year, ladies!" they called. "Take the jump. Show what you can do for leap year!" Some women stepped down onto the street to walk around, but many accepted the challenge. They lifted their skirts above their ankles and jumped.</p><p></p><p>Young men executed most of the pranks that night, but the females were hardly blameless. Groups of them clasped hands to each other's shoulders to form daisy chains, then ran into the crowd, whipping through it with merry violence. Late in the evening, at Forty-sixth Street and Broadway -- was Terrance there to see it? -- a dozen young women encircled a well-dressed young man. Locking their arms together, they refused to let him escape. The young man repeatedly tried to bash his way out of their circle but the young women only pushed him back into the center, taunting and jeering him. A policeman finally rescued the hapless young man, but not before the women had kicked his silk hat down Broadway.</p><p></p><p>What Terrance could not have witnessed that night were the diamond-clad women smoking cigarettes inside the glittering precincts of Rector's and Martin's. These two Broadway restaurants, among others, had relaxed their usual restrictions and allowed female patrons to indulge in tobacco, a fact so remarkable it was recorded on front pages of newspapers around the country. Much as Americans would tune their television sets to watch the ball drop in Times Square in later years, they looked to New York that New Year's Eve for excitement, dismay, and provocation. On the night of the first-ever ball-drop, New York did not disappoint.</p><p></p><p>Just before midnight, a hush fell over the crowd. All eyes rose to the top of the Times building. Up there, hovering over the city beyond the glare of powerful searchlights, poised at the tip of the seventy-foot flagpole, a giant glittering sphere waited to fall. It was five feet in diameter, seven hundred pounds in weight, and cloaked in 216 white lights. Nobody could have guessed they were about to witness the debut of a custom that would still mark the New Year a century later; nor was it likely, at this moment, that anyone was peering so far ahead. It was enough, in the remaining seconds of 1907, to contemplate the difficulties of the year behind and the promises of the year ahead.</p><p></p><p>The crowd began to count backward: tens of thousands of voices rising to the sky above New York, joined together in anticipation of something new and marvelous. Then the gleaming orb fell and bright white numbers flashed on the roof of the Times building: 1908: 1908: 1908.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the long glide down to 125th Street, Terrance could either pedal furiously to gather speed, then take his chances dodging whatever traffic might be passing along 125th Street -- thereby preserving his momentum for the long ascent to Morningside Heights -- or he could veer east on 125th Street. The latter was the easier, more sensible route. The thoroughfare would have been quiet on New Year's Day. A few horses would be standing at the curb before their carts, snorting patiently. An automobile might rumble past, but automobiles were still scarce in Harlem, since not many people living on fifteen or twenty dollars a week could afford one. Other than the piles of horse manure, which Terrance would be mindful to dodge, the street promised a smooth ride over macadam.</p><p></p><p>A few effortless blocks, then Terrance would turn south again, skirting Morningside Park. To his right, across the park, rose the stony cliffs of Morningside Heights. Atop them, blotting the weak afternoon sun, loomed the gray walls of St. John the Divine, the great cathedral begun the year Terrance was born and still in the infancy of its construction. The plain of Jewish Harlem spread out to the east. The road was flat all the way south to Central Park. Terrance's legs would still be fresh when he got there.</p><p></p><p>Had there ever been a finer time to be an American boy on a bicycle than on that first day of the new year of 1908? Certainly the interests and passions of a sixteen-year-old had never coincided so perfectly with those of his country. America was very much an adolescent itself, brash and exuberant, stirring with strange and urgent new longings, one moment supremely confident and clever, the next undone by giddiness and hormones. The psychologist G. Stanley Hall had recently coined the term "adolescence" to describe the passionate "new birth" that occurred in humans between childhood and maturity. It was, wrote Hall, a phase characterized by "storm and stress," but also by joy and delight, as "old moorings were broken and a higher level attained." The description fit the America of 1908 ...</p></p><h2>Homeopathic Medicine:: First Aid and Emergency Care</h2><p>Discover how homeopathic remedies can be used as a gentle first aid treatment for a wide variety of illnesses and injuries.</p><p>A practicing homeopathic physician and educator for 30 years, Dr. Morgan is also the author of <em>Homeopathic Treatment of Sports Injuries</em>.</p><h2>Mother of Storms</h2><p>A single nuclear strike in the North Pacific unleashes a series of extraordinary and deadly hurricanes that inundate the Pacific rim, obliterating everything in their paths, while a small group of visionary technologists comes up with an unusual scheme to save the world</p><p><p>JOHN BARNES is the author of more than thirty science fiction novels, including <i>Orbital Resonance</i>, <i>A Million Open Doors</i>, <i>Finity</i>, and <i>Directive 51</i>.

When the magnetic catapult on the mothership throws his little spaceplane forward and he kicks in his scramjets, somewhere over Afghanistan, he'll sail up and away into a high suborbital trajectory over the pole. Hassan has never gotten authorized for orbit, but this is pretty close.It's his first real mission. He's carrying four cram bombs--"Compressing Radiation Antimatter" is what it stands for, and when they talk to the media they are supposed to stress that they are "mass-to-energy, not really nuclear" weapons, because for all practical purposes they are baby nukes and that's bad PR.The catch is that damned jack in the back of his head. He accepted a lot of extra money from Passionet to have it installed and to fly with it, it's going to make him rich--and in UNSOO that's not common--but there is still the nagging feeling of showing off. After all, he's a pilot, not an actor."We're getting ready to go plugged with you," the voice from Passionet says. "If you've got any embarrassing thoughts to get out of the way, think them now.""None I know of. I'm at orbital injection minus four minutes." Hassan does his best to sound bored."We know--timing's perfect. Give our folks a ride."Just as they click off and it goes live, he does have the strange thought that there really don't have to be human crews for UN Space Ops like this--a machine could do a prohibited-weapons interdict just as well. He finds himself wondering why he does this--no, to his shame, why he is fearing doing it.That makes his stomach knot hard during the last instants of countdown. Then he hears the word "inject" and the mothership catapult flings him forward over the nose of the big airplane; watching his stability gauge, he sees it's all go, waits a few more seconds till the navigation computer has a fix, and then flips the scramjet lever.He is slammed into his seat again, and the brown-and-white mountains of early spring morning fall away below him. The vibration is heavy, and the pressure is intense; he sees the West Siberian plain open out beneath him, wrapped in its canopy of blue air. He is as high up as weather satellites go. His heart is pounding and despite the military reason for the mission he is mentally lost in the scenery.By the time the scramjets cut out, there is polar ice on the horizon, and his hands automatically begin their ritual of arming and readying the shots.He arcs higher still, coasting upward on inertia, and now the Earthbegins to return toward him. He is weightless--not because there is no gravity but because he is moving with it--and he has an intense recollection of his childhood fantasies about space travel. He hopes they won't mind having that in the wedge they are recording--Over the pole now, falling nose-down across the ice cap ninety miles below, and the countdown begins; his weapons lock on target and he need only pull the trigger on cue to turn over control to the missiles themselves. He receives the go-ahead and initiates.There are four hard shoves on the little spaceplane, and he sees his missiles falling away like sparklers thrown down a dark canyon. He will miss their impact off the North Slope, but the pleasure of launching them was exquisite.And from the jack in his head, he is informed that 750 million people shared the experience.There's a cherry-red glow around the bottom of the spaceplane, and weight begins to return as the plane once again resists gravity rather than rides with it. It was more like a training flight than he expected. He's never seen Pacificanada, but he's told the new, struggling nation loves UN Peacekeeping Forces credits, and he will have plenty.As he falls back toward home, life seems pretty sweet when it can include things like this.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Randy Householder is cruising I-80 out of Sacramento in a car so old it had to be retrofitted to drive itself. It runs and it's what he can afford, and he doesn't worry about it.But he's trying to get onto the net, and that is unbelievably slow and frustrating tonight. After fourteen years he's learned that this always means the same thing--some damn crisis tying things up. Back in i when the Flash happened, it was six days before he could get on and get his messages. At least this time he can get them, but they're slow.It's been a long time since he's been impressed by getting a hundred messages. That's normal traffic. About half of it will be some small-town police chiefs, sheriffs, magistrates, proconsuls, ombudsmen, whatever they call them around the world, mostly letting him know they're still looking for evidence and that nothing has come in. A few will be new ones taking over, some will be old ones leaving and letting him know their successors may not be helpful.The other half will be people like Randy, mostly just passing along support notes. There are seven others Randy hears from most nights--all the ones who had children killed in a way similar to what happened toKimbie Dee. They're always there. Sometimes he talks with them live; they've traded pictures and such over the years.There will almost always be at least one reporter. Randy does not talk to reporters anymore. The damn media take up too much of the bandwidth on the net--like they're doing tonight. And they're no help.Last time he talked to one, she kept wanting to know about how he lives his life. Shit, Randy told her, he didn't have a life. He stopped having a life fourteen years ago when the cops came to the door of his mobile home, and made him and his then-wife Terry sit down, and told them that Kimbie Dee had been murdered, and it looked like a sex murder. Life stopped when they told him they had the man who did it and no clues about motive, but they knew damned well from the jack driven into her skull <i>why</i> she'd been murdered and raped--Christ, Christ, the coroner had said she'd been jammed with a mop handle hard enough to rupture her intestines, and then raped while she hemorrhaged, but she'd still been conscious when the man hanged her.Randy's clutching at his keyboard with his fists and that does no good. <i>Stay relaxed, stay calm, keep hunting. It's going to be a long one, you've always known that.</i>Kimbie Dee was killed to make an XV wedge. There's a big underground market in those things. Once or twice a year, someone is arrested for selling the one that features her death. Sometimes they arrest the guy he bought it from; sometimes Randy is able to hack the files about one of the suspects, and find more people who might be involved. Now and then--the last time was three years ago--something cross-correlates, and Randy's datarodents bring him back one more piece of information, move him another step up one of the distribution chains.When that happens, there's an arrest. Randy gets reward money. Like he cares crap about that. But Randy and the world's cops get one step closer to the guy who paid for it; somewhere out there, some big shot, someone with more income to spend on his "fun" than Randy ever made in any year of his life, is still at large and unsuspected. He's the man who handed all that money to a man and said, "Here's what I want you to do to a pert little blonde girl."The man who killed and raped Kimbie Dee Householder has been in his grave for eleven years. Randy was there to see him strapped into the chair. The man who hired it done is still out there.Randy's going to see him dead, too.Just as soon as all this damned noise gets off the net. He checks the text news channels and finds it's some stupid thing about Alaska, Siberia, the UN,and atomic bombs. He vaguely remembers Alaska got independent right after the Flash--the UN made the U.S. give it up, or something.President Hardshaw is going to talk about it to the media later; Randy will tune in to that on the TV--he votes for her every time and he never misses one of her speeches. She was Idaho Attorney General back a little before the murder. If she'd still been in office--she and the guy they now call the President's Shadow, Harris Diem--instead of the liberal "concerned" homo Democrat that was--they'd've tracked down the bastards and nailed them while the crime was still hot. Randy's sure of it. So he doesn't need to think about World War Three; he can let the President sort that one out. Everyone has their little job.Back to Randy's. Just keep plugging away. "We'll get him yet, Kimbie Dee, even if the whole world has to come apart," he says. He tells the car to head east, toward Salt Lake City, because the satellite connections will be better and cheaper. Then he climbs into the back, opens the fridge, gets himself a beer, calls up the file of messages, and starts sorting through his mail.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Some perverse spirit, somewhere out there, has decided that this is the big year for Ed Porter to work with amateurs. Probably some woman, some upper-level bitch who doesn't like the way the wedges he edits sell like crazy, or the shows he assembles dominate the net. But he's the main reason Passionet is XV of choice for female experiencers, and third among males. A <i>romance</i> net, for god's sake, at the top even among men, and Porter is one of three senior editors there, and they still persecute him. They still give him shit assignments like this.It's gotta be some woman.Anyway, at least he's away from Boring Bill and Cotton-Brains Candy, as he calls them. A whole two-day vacation from "Dream Honeymoon" to work on this breaking story.But this guy Hassan, this pilot, is a <i>stiff</i>. He's pure military. Gets excited but holds it in. His pulse rises but not enough. What comes in through the jack is a smart guy doing a job he's good at. Even when he fires the bombs off, there's just a minor thrill. And of course the silly bombs are just going through the ice, into the mud of the North Slope; through Hassan's eyes, all Porter sees is some bright sparks plunging down toward the nightdarkened ice. Nobody down there to burn, or to scream with pain; nobody up here in Hassan's brain to exult in the destruction or laugh maniacally at people dying; no agony, no passion, nothing. Nothing to experience but the smooth working of a machine, according to a perfect plan.As XV goes, it's a zero.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Jesse knows Naomi wants him to be more interested, and she is right, and it is a big deal--if he wants any confirmation he only has to listen to the hundreds of students milling around in the PolAc Room. Even for U of the Az, this is a big crowd, but then you don't get to see a UN Space Ops bombing raid in real time every day.Of course instead of the old-fashioned television, he could just as easily be back at the dorm--Passionet has wired one of the pilots--and be there for all practical purposes. Maybe catch it on replay? No, Naomi calls that warpom.What he'd really rather be is home with Naomi, no TV, no XV, no clothes--he shoves the thought back, hard. If he even hints in the next hour it'll be another fight with Naomi, and he doesn't want that, not right now. It's been a week since they've more than kissed.On the other hand Molecular Design Economics, which he's got to pass with a Significant Achievement or better, this term, if he's going to stay on track for his Realization Engineering degree, is at eight A.M., it's already almost ten, and though his homework is done he hasn't reviewed it or read the supplementary chapter.Still, Naomi's back--tiny and soft to the touch but with rock-hard muscle underneath--is against his chest, and therefore the nicest tight round butt in the Az is a quarter inch from him.There's a lot of noise and Jesse looks up to see what it is. Something big, anyway, a lot of flickery movement on the screen. Everyone is arguing about that; nowadays you don't see an image flicker like that, not with packetized digital signal.It's not coming in well, he realizes, because UN Information Control is trying to slap their logo across it and it's not quite working. People are booing and hissing, some of them at the UNIC insignia, some at what's behind it, some on general principles.Like every college assembly room built in the last century, this place wasn't made to meet in, it was made to be easy to clean, so it has plenty of hard, flat surfaces and the whole thing is echoing and ringing.Call it midnight before they get home, and she'll want to talk for an hour ... there goes the homework even if there's no sex. And getting a Significant Achievement is no piece of cake; sure, it's the lowest of the academic grades, but it's still light-years in effort beyond Probable Comprehension, Positive Attitude, or Open Mind--and employers nowadays really do read your transcript. It's got to be Significant Achievement, Demonstrated Competence, or Mastery ... and he thinks by now the top two are out of his reach.Absent Naomi in his life, Mastery would be in his reach in most subjects. There's a lot of easier ass in the world--He has no idea why he can't concentrate these days. He forces his eyes back to the screen, notices a dark bar across it, realizes what he's looking at is Naomi's hand, palm down, in the gesture for "quiet" that they used in grade school when you were a kid.The room is so noisy, between boos, catcalls, people loudly explaining things to each other, and other people shushing and shouting "Quiet, please, quiet!," all echoing off all those hard, flat surfaces, that he can't think anyway. He wants to just turn into a caveman, drag Naomi out of here bodily, heave her into his old Lectrajeep, drive out to someplace in the desert, and just stare up at the stars until the sun comes up.After he has hours of intense sex with a completely willing Naomi.The image on the screen, when he can see it through all the waving hands and fingers, is now stuttering rapidly, because the source of the signal is switching protocols and channels a few times per second, and the UNIC tracker-suppressor software is right on its tail. Jesse knows that because for Realization Engineering you have to take a ton of cryptography (the important part of RE from the standpoint of <i>los corporados</i> is keeping everything you do from instantly being run through an AIRE--an Artificially Intelligent Reverse Engineer--and winding up in public domain). God, engineering is more interesting and fun than politics.What would Naomi think of the way he's thinking? It's bad enough he can only seem to think of her as a sex bunny, but when he gets his mind out of his crotch all he can think about is the technical stuff, not about the political side. Why won't his mind stay on track?Naomi leans back farther, that angel's butt brushes the front of his pants, and at least he isn't thinking of homework anymore. For just a second the screen swims clear, and it looks like the Siberian comware is beating UNIC's hounds--you can hear the nationals in the room cheering, the uniters booing, and it occurs to him it's not that different from a football game--Back to the stutter. Naomi is still making the "quiet" signal. The crowd is getting rowdier, not quieter, so she's shrinking back against him. Tentatively he lets his hand rest on her waist, hoping it will read as support and not as what she calls "groping me all the t...</p><h2>Stealing Lincoln&#39;s Body</h2><p><p> On the night of the presidential election in 1876, a gang of counterfeiters out of Chicago attempted to steal the entombed embalmed body of Abraham Lincoln and hold it for ransom. The custodian of the tomb was so shaken by the incident that he willingly dedicated the rest of his life to protecting the president's corpse. </p><p> </p><p> In a lively and dramatic narrative, Thomas J. Craughwell returns to this bizarre, and largely forgotten, event with the first book to place the grave robbery in historical context. He takes us through the planning and execution of the crime and the outcome of the investigation. He describes the reactions of Mary Todd Lincoln and Robert Todd Lincoln to the theft&#x2014;and the peculiar silence of a nation. He follows the unlikely tale of what happened to Lincoln's remains after the attempted robbery, and details the plan devised by the Lincoln Guard of Honor to prevent a similar abominable recurrence. </p><p> </p><p> Along the way, Craughwell offers entertaining sidelights on the rise of counterfeiting in America and the establishment of the Secret Service to combat it; the prevalence of grave robberies; the art of nineteenth-century embalming; and the emergence among Irish immigrants of an ambitious middle class&#x2014;and a criminal underclass. </p><p> </p><p> This rousing story of hapless con men, intrepid federal agents, and ordinary Springfield citizens who honored their native son by keeping a valuable, burdensome secret for decades offers a riveting glimpse into late-nineteenth-century America, and underscores that truth really is sometimes stranger than fiction. </p></p><p>Amazon Significant Seven, April 2007: Thomas Craughwell exhumes a fascinating and bizarre Lincoln tale that you didn't hear in school: The plot hatched by a group of Chicago counterfeiters to steal Honest Abe's remains and ransom them for $200,000 and the release of an imprisoned cohort. Though ultimately unsuccessful, the brazen scheme launched The First Cadaver on a peripatetic 25-year journey to its final, concrete-encased resting place. Along the way, <i>Stealing Lincoln's Body</i> detours into the story of rampant counterfeiting prior to and through the Civil War that nearly bankrupted the U.S. treasury, the scoundrelly origins of the Secret Service, and some of the stranger embalming techniques of 19th-century America. <i>--Jon Foro</i> <br><br>Thomas J.

A room in the broken-�down home belonged to her son Moses. A sizable hole in its wall allowed water in whenever it rained. The money for improvements and a better life had been placed before them by Buckwalter, a pro basketball executive. Buckwalter empowered Moses Malone with a choice. He offered Malone riches over poverty. Malone just had to forsake the rest of his childhood.<br><br>Moses Malone was an unassuming, gangly teenager from the South. He lived in Petersburg, Virginia, in a duplex off St. Matthews Street. The city was once a major Civil War conflict zone. In 1974, it hosted Malone, a teenager who happened to be basketball&#x2019;s greatest recruiting prize since Kareem Abdul-�Jabbar. The sport came easily to Malone. He competed in playgrounds against adults. The kids received orange juice for winning. If they lost, they rounded up spare change to give their elders some beer money. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d beat them so bad, they thought they were already drunk,&#x201d; Malone recalled with a hearty laugh. College recruiters arrived in droves to watch Malone at Petersburg High School, where he steered his team to 50 straight victories and back-�to-�back state championships, forsaking their families and checking into hotels for months. One day, a representative from Oral Roberts pledged that a higher power would cure Mary Malone&#x2019;s bleeding ulcer should her son bless the school with his basketball abilities.<br><br>His talent traveled by word of mouth in an era when college recruiters routinely circumvented NCAA rules of amateurism. A wink could mean a new car for a recruit and a turned head could result in the transfer of a handful of money. &#x201c;It was like the Wild West,&#x201d; noted Howard White, then an assistant coach at the University of Maryland. Recruiters found Malone a reluctant listener. When they drove him in their cars, he feigned being asleep. When they came to his house, he pretended that he was not home. He had heard so many pitches that they had blended together by the time he finally committed to stay close to home and attend Maryland. When Maryland&#x2019;s coach, Lefty Driesell, learned of Malone&#x2019;s pending intentions, he camped outside the Malones&#x2019; home. Malone awakened at about 7 a.m., wiping the sleep from his eyes. Driesell, at his bedside, came into focus. Malone signed the offer before rolling over and returning to sleep.<br><br>Then, Buckwalter, his money, and the American Basketball Association came along. The upstart league was widely viewed as inferior to the National Basketball Association&#x2019;s purer, more technical brand of basketball. The 11-�team ABA originated in 1967 and predicated itself on showmanship, with its red-�and-�white ball and three-�point line. The league existed in the NBA&#x2019;s shadow, but exploited a crack in luring talent by accepting players with remaining college eligibility. The NBA finally relented, following Spencer Haywood&#x2019;s antitrust lawsuit, and allowed players to leave college early and join their ranks if they could prove a financial hardship. But no high school player had ascended straight into basketball&#x2019;s major leagues. (The Detroit Pistons had drafted Reggie Harding out of high school in 1962, but he first played in basketball&#x2019;s minor leagues before joining the NBA.) By chance, Buckwalter, the director of player personnel for the ABA&#x2019;s Utah Stars, had stumbled upon one of Malone&#x2019;s high school All-�Star Games. He marveled at Malone&#x2019;s blend of height and quickness. A hard wind would have blown Malone over. He stood 6 feet 11 inches tall and weighed just over 200 pounds. But his feet danced like those of a boxer. They never stopped moving on the basketball court. The colleges wanted the best basketball players. Buckwalter did, too. The Stars drafted Malone in the third round of the ABA&#x2019;s 1974 draft. Most viewed the selection as little more than a publicity stunt, although it granted the Stars the ability to negotiate a contract with Malone.<br><br>Buckwalter had heard rumblings about the envelopes stuffed with money that one of Malone&#x2019;s uncles requested just to let a recruiter meet with the teenager. Buckwalter had to sneak under a fence and narrowly avoided the jaws of a dog simply to knock at their front door. Mary Malone answered the door. Buckwalter glanced at the scarce furnishings. Mary Malone had four pictures on her mantel: one each of Jesus Christ, Martin Luther King Jr., John and Jackie Kennedy, and her son Moses.<br><br>Buckwalter knew that Moses Malone had heard every possible spiel. He discussed being a pioneer with Malone. Malone stared and mumbled. Buckwalter offered to build the family a new house.<br><br>&#x201c;This is yours,&#x201d; Buckwalter said after he put the money on the crate. &#x201c;This is for you and your friends. This isn&#x2019;t like Maryland, where you never really see anything.&#x201d;<br><br>Malone nodded and mumbled some more. He left the room and phoned Lefty Driesell. &#x201c;Coach Buckwalter is over here and he&#x2019;s got $25,000 in cash lying on my table,&#x201d; Malone told Driesell. &#x201c;He wants me to sign this thing. Should I sign it?&#x201d;<br><br>Driesell did not miss a beat. &#x201c;Tell them to leave,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And if they don&#x2019;t, call the police. Now, if he puts a million dollars on your table, then call me back.&#x201d;<br><br>Driesell&#x2019;s enthusiasm could drown out the voices of the hundreds of other coaches who lusted after Malone. Driesell was a marvelous, relentless recruiter. He had told Malone that they could start counting their national championships together. He planned to pair Malone with John Lucas, a talented guard, and purchase him an insurance package should an injury derail his future professional career. Driesell sold the university to Malone. More importantly, he sold himself to Mary Malone. She supported herself and Moses, first as a practical nurse and then as a meatpacker. Moses&#x2019;s father had left the family before his son turned two. Driesell told Mary Malone that he was a God-�fearing man and Maryland was a Christian-�based program.<br><br>He was not going to lose Moses Malone without a fight. Driesell had successfully and skillfully fended off the other college recruiters. He now planned on struggling for Malone all over again. He preached the sanctity of college. He told the Malones that he had their best interests at heart and recommended that the Malones talk to an agent acquaintance, Donald Dell, and his partner, Lee Fentress, before making any decision.<br><br>The Malones agreed to the meeting. Dell found Malone to be aloof&#x2014;�as all the college coaches had. He wanted his attention.<br><br>&#x201c;Moses, have you ever heard of slavery?&#x201d; Dell asked.<br><br>Malone&#x2019;s head snapped up. &#x201c;Well, this contract you&#x2019;ve been offered is slavery.&#x201d; The contract, Dell said, ran for 16 years. Utah only guaranteed the first four years, with a team option for the next dozen years. &#x201c;I hated the contract they offered him,&#x201d; Dell recalled. &#x201c;I thought it was chickenshit that they arrived at their house and put all that money on the dining room table of a poor person&#x2019;s home. The whole thing smelled.&#x201d; Dell wearily agreed to represent Malone in the negotiations. &#x201c;I was very, very worried that he wouldn&#x2019;t make the team or he would turn into something less than he wanted to be,&#x201d; Dell said. &#x201c;A young eighteen-�year-�old with no education. That&#x2019;s what I was really worried about and I really didn&#x2019;t sleep for a couple of weeks thinking about it.&#x201d;<br><br>But Malone&#x2019;s decision had been made long ago. At 14, he had scribbled in the back of his Bible that he wanted to be a professional athlete. To reject this opportunity meant turning his back on the gift. &#x201c;I said if I make this decision, this decision is going to be on me,&#x201d; Malone said. He had remained mostly quiet throughout the process. His muteness did not reflect the lack of interest it often projected. &#x201c;What I do is listen and pay attention,&#x201d; Malone said. &#x201c;I listen to words and I can tell if they&#x2019;re trustworthy or if they&#x2019;re honest.&#x201d;<br><br>The Maryland players offered Malone their combined per diem for food and laundry, about $15 a month from each player, in an effort to make him stay in college. His college career lasted all of five days. John Lucas, his roommate, tried stirring Malone one morning. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, we&#x2019;ve got to go,&#x201d; Lucas said.<br><br>&#x201c;Big Mo going pro,&#x201d; Malone replied. &#x201c;Big Mo can&#x2019;t take these damn college hours.&#x201d; He signed a seven-�year contract with Utah that would pay him up to $3 million.<br><br>���<br><br>Moses Malone&#x2019;s leap from high school did not immediately change professional basketball&#x2019;s landscape. In a hierarchy of natural progression, players starred in high school and made their names in college before graduating to the pros. Darryl Dawkins and Bill Willoughby jumped to the NBA from high school a year after Malone&#x2019;s decision. Malone joined the NBA in 1976, when the league absorbed much of the ABA, and carved out a Hall of Fame career. But Dawkins and Willoughby provided cautionary tales for different reasons as to why teenagers, both physically and mentally, were not prepared for the NBA&#x2019;s rigors.<br><br>That thought persisted until a lanky teenager named Kevin Garnett reopened the dormant door in 1995. The game had been transformed by the time of Garnett&#x2019;s arrival. Players commanded millions in salary, a large jump from $130,000&#x2014;�the average salary of an NBA player in 1976. Malone&#x2019;s decision ultimately birthed the route into the NBA for one of the game&#x2019;s greatest group of players, from Garnett to Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, LeBron James, and Dwight Howard. They grew into stardom, while quickly advancing from their proms to playing against grown men whose paychecks accounted for how they fed their families. &#x201c;When I see guys like Kobe, LeBron James, Kevin Garnett still doing what they&#x2019;re doing, it just makes all the high school players that came before very proud,&#x201d; Malone said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re doing what we&#x2019;re doing because we were the best in high school and we ain&#x2019;t got to go to college for four years to be the best.&#x201d; They did not first toil in minor leagues, as in professional baseball and hockey. They did not have to wait three years after high school before becoming professionals, like NFL players. Most became successful and, lacking stardom, made more money than they would have otherwise dreamed of. A few failed and faded with their chance at fame and fortune eternally lost.<br><br>They all started at the same place. At an early age, they showed remarkable physical gifts and someone pegged each of them as a phenom. The days of a talent undiscovered until college are long gone. High school games are televised across the country. Elementary-�school children are ranked nationally. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the same reason we want to see young, gifted actors, musicians, or pianists,&#x201d; said Jeremy Treatman. Treatman served as one of Kobe Bryant&#x2019;s high school assistant coaches and later scheduled and broadcast marquee high school games. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re phenoms,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re prodigies. LeBron James was a prodigy. Dwight Howard&#x2019;s a prodigy. Kobe Bryant&#x2019;s a prodigy. When someone can do things that no one else can, you&#x2019;re just blown away by it. Even when you&#x2019;re seeing a seven-�year-�old girl sing the national anthem perfectly and you&#x2019;re blown away for days. It&#x2019;s that kind of thing.&#x201d; But the attention often came with a price: an abbreviated childhood and mostly unrealistic expectations. &#x201c;The hustle and bustle, prostitution, drugs, gang banging, and all that [in his neighborhood] to the AAU [Amateur Athletic Union] circuit was no different,&#x201d; said Tyson Chandler, taken second overall in the 2001 draft out of high school. &#x201c;It was the same hustle. It was just legal. It was definitely the same characters I would see on my street corner, just disguised different. My life was accelerated because I had to learn how to protect myself and use people who thought they were using me and do all of that to get to where I wanted to get to. I was very aware of what was going on at such a young age. That innocence is kind of thrown out the window.&#x201d;<br><br>Malone&#x2019;s decision to fulfill his own prophecy mutated over the years. A decision faced by a modern NBA prospect who considered the jump from high school became saturated with too many parties all with a stake in his future: the coaches, the families, the shoe companies, the NBA, the handlers, the agents. Former NBA commissioner David Stern began presiding over NBA drafts that may as well have been high school graduations. The procession stopped in 2006 with a rule mandating draft-�eligible players be at least one year removed from high school. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a failing of so many institutions, for which I think we are drawn into it,&#x201d; Stern said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean to take any attention, cut away any responsibility, because we&#x2019;re part of the system, but we&#x2019;re not the lead part of the system.&#x201d;<br><br>They are the end goal, the league kids dreamed of and, for a while, played in. The ban on high school players is continually discussed. Some want it eliminated. Others want to extend the league&#x2019;s age minimum to at least 20 years. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just not right,&#x201d; said Jermaine O&#x2019;Neal. He jumped to the NBA from high school in 1996. &#x201c;You can go to the military and fight a war at eighteen years old and give your life at 18 years old. Those people are going to war to try to better their lives. It&#x2019;s life or death in the military. You&#x2019;re allowed to carry a gun and give your life. That&#x2019;s the ultimate sacrifice. So my question is, Why aren&#x2019;t you allowed to do something as simple as play basketball?&#x201d;</p><h2>Dragonfly in Amber</h2><p><b>NOW THE STARZ ORIGINAL SERIES <i>OUTLANDER</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>With her classic novel </i>Outlander, <i>Diana Gabaldon introduced two unforgettable characters&#x2014;Claire Randall and Jamie Fraser&#x2014;delighting readers with a story of adventure and love that spanned two centuries.

My pillow's deep. Today's the day I'm going to sleep!" But the rhyming words of Dr. Seuss and goofy illustrations from James Stevenson will surely get more than a few giggles from the old <i>and</i> the young, as everyone in town--from brothers and sisters to the police and the Marines--conspires to get our little hero out of bed. But, as the sleepy boy says, "nobody's going to get me up, no matter what he does." (Not with tickling nor shaking nor cold water on the head.) "Nothing's going to get me up.

Her skin was dry and the dark circles under her eyes were more pronounced than they'd been when she went to bed.<br><br> Denise sneered at her reflection in the mirror. She had now spent an hour on damage control, but it was never good enough.<br><br> "You look and smell like a hooker," she said, mimicking her grandmother's voice as she applied her eyeliner one more time.<br><br> In the studio apartments around her, the noise signaled that the other tenants were waking up and that it would soon be evening again. It was a well-known cacophony of sounds: the chinking of bottles, the knocking on doors to bum cigarettes, and the constant traffic to and from the run-down toilet with shower that the contract described as exclusive.<br><br> The small society of Danish outcasts from one of the darker streets of Frederiksstaden was now set in motion for yet another evening with no real purpose.<br><br> After turning around a few times, she stepped toward the mirror to inspect her face close-up.<br><br> "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?" She laughed with an indulgent smile as she caressed her reflection with her fingertips. She puckered her lips, let her fingers slide up her hips, over her breasts, up to her neck, and into her hair. She picked some fluff from her angora blouse and dabbed a little foundation on a couple of insufficiently covered blemishes on her face before stepping back with satisfaction. Her plucked and painted eyebrows together with NeuLash-enhanced eyelashes added to her overall appearance. The makeup, together with the glow of her irises, gave her a more intense look, adding with ease an extra element of aloofness.<br><br> In other words, she was ready to take on the world.<br><br> "I'm Denise," she practiced saying, tensing her throat. It was as deep as her voice could be.<br><br> "Denise," she whispered, slowly parting her lips and letting her chin drop toward her chest. The result was fantastic when she adopted this attitude. Some might interpret her look as submissive, but it was exactly the opposite. Wasn't it precisely at this angle that the hotspots-a woman's eyelashes and pupils-best caught the attention of those around her?<br><br> Totally in control. She nodded, screwing the lid of her face cream back on and piling her arsenal of cosmetics back in the bathroom cabinet.<br><br> After a quick look around the small room she realized that hours of hard work lay ahead of her: clearing away the laundry, making the bed, washing all the glasses, taking out the trash, and sorting all the bottles.<br><br> Fuck it, she thought, grabbing the duvet and shaking it and plumping the pillow, convincing herself that when one of her sugar daddies had made it this far, he wouldn't give a damn about the rest.<br><br> She sat on the edge of the bed and checked that her handbag had all the essentials she would need.<br><br> She nodded with satisfaction. She was ready to take on the world and all its desires.<br><br> An unwelcome sound made her turn to face the door. Click, clack, click, clack, came the limping, loathsome sound.<br><br> You're far too early, Mother, she thought as the door outside between the stairs and the corridor was pushed open.<br><br> It was almost eight o'clock, so why was she coming now? It was way past her dinnertime.<br><br> She counted the seconds, already feeling irritated as she got up from the bed, when the knock came at the door.<br><br> "Honey!" she heard her mother shouting from the other side. "Won't you open the door?" Denise took deep breaths, remaining silent. If she didn't answer, her mother would surely just go.<br><br> "Denise, I know you're in there. Open up just for a moment. I have something important to tell you."<br><br> Denise sighed. "And why should I do that? I don't suppose you brought any dinner up with you?" she shouted.<br><br> "Not today, no. Oh, won't you come downstairs to eat, Denise? Just for today. Your grandmother is here!"<br><br> Denise rolled her eyes. So her grandmother was downstairs. The mere thought was enough to make her heart race and cause her to break out in a sweat.<br><br> "Grandmother can kiss my ass. I hate that bitch."<br><br> "Oh, Denise, you mustn't talk like that. Won't you just let me in for a moment? I really must speak with you."<br><br> "Not now. Just leave the dinner in front of the door, as usual." Apart from the man with the flabby skin who lived a few doors down the corridor, who had already downed his first beer of the day and was now sobbing in despair over his miserable existence, it was suddenly totally quiet out in the corridor. It wouldn't surprise her if everyone was pricking up their ears right at this moment, but what did she care? They could just ignore her mother like she did.<br><br> Denise filtered out the sound of her mother's pleas, concentrating instead on the whining coming from the loser down the hall. All the divorced men like him living in studio apartments were just so pathetic and laughable. How could they believe the future might be brighter given how they looked? They stank of unwashed clothes and drank themselves into oblivion in their pitiful loneliness. How could these cringeworthy idiots live with being so pathetic?<br><br> Denise snorted. How often had they stood in front of her door in an effort to tempt her with their small talk and cheap wine from Aldi, their eyes betraying hope of something else and more?<br><br> As if she would ever associate with men who lived in studio apartments.<br><br> "She's brought money with her for us, Denise," her mother said insistently.<br><br> Now she had Denise's attention.<br><br> "You simply have to come down with me because if you don't she won't give us anything for this month."<br><br> There was a pause before she spoke again.<br><br> "And then we really won't have anything, will we, Denise?" she said severely.<br><br> "Can't you shout a little louder so they can also hear you in the next building?" Denise retorted.<br><br> "Denise!" Her mother's voice was now quivering. "I'm warning you. If your grandmother doesn't give us that money, you'll have to go to the social services office because I haven't paid your rent for this month. Or maybe you thought I had?"<br><br> Denise took a deep breath, went over to the mirror, and put on her lipstick one final time. Ten minutes with the woman and then she was out of there. She had nothing but shit and confrontation coming her way. The bitch wouldn't leave her in peace for a second. She would just come with demand after demand. And if there was something Denise couldn't deal with, it was all the demands people put on her. It simply drained all the life and energy out of her.<br><br> It depleted her.<br><br> Down on the first floor in her mother�s apartment there was a not unexpected stench of tinned mock turtle soup. Once in a while it might be cutlets only just past their sell-by date or rice pudding in sausage-shaped plastic packaging. There wasn�t exactly entrec&#x2122;te on the menu when her mother attempted to put on a spread, which the blemished silver-plated candlesticks with spluttering candles emphasized.<br><br> In this flickering artificial ambience the vulture was already seated at the center of the table, scowling and ready to attack. Denise was almost knocked out from the stench of her cheap perfume and powder, which no shop with any self-respect would demean itself to sell.<br><br> Now her grandmother parted her dry, red, blotchy lips. Maybe the vulture was preparing to smile, but Denise was not so easily fooled. She attempted to count to ten but this time made it to only three before the woman's verbal abuse began.<br><br> "Well! The little princess could finally find time to come down and say hello."<br><br> A dark and disapproving look came over the grandmother's face after a quick inspection of Denise's seminude midriff.<br><br> "Already plastered with makeup and I don't know what. No one will miss you coming, because that really would be a catastrophe, wouldn't it, Dorrit?"<br><br> "Would you stop calling me that? It's almost ten years since I changed my name."<br><br> "Since you ask so politely, yes, as it isn't something one is accustomed to from you. Then you think that name becomes you better, do you . . . Denise? A little more French. It almost puts one in mind of the suggestively dressed ladies of the night, so, yes, maybe it is more fitting." She looked her up and down. "Then congratulations with the camouflage work, is all I can say. You've prepared yourself for the hunt, I wouldn't wonder."<br><br> Denise noticed how her mother tried to calm the mood with a slight touch of her hand on her grandmother's arm, as if that had ever worked. Even in that area her mother had always been weak.<br><br> "And what have you been up to, if one might inquire?" continued her grandmother. "There was something about a new course, or was it actually an internship?" She squinted. "Was it a job as a nail technician you wanted to try this time? I almost can't keep up with all the excitement in your life, so you'll have to help me. But wait, maybe you're not actually doing anything at the moment? Could that be it?"<br><br> Denise didn't answer. She just tried to keep her lips sealed. Her grandmother raised her eyebrows. "Oh yes, you're much too precious for work, aren't you?"<br><br> Why did she bother asking when she had all the answers? Why was she sitting there hiding behind her wiry grey hair in a mask of disgust? It made you want to spit at her. What stopped her from doing it?<br><br> "Denise has decided to enroll in a course to learn how to coach people," interjected her mother bravely.<br><br> The metamorphosis was enormous. Her grandmother's mouth was open, aghast; the wrinkles on her nose disappeared; and after a short pause the change was accompanied by a laugh that came so deep from within her rotten core that it made the hair on Denise's neck stand on end.<br><br> "Oh, that's what she's decided, is it? An interesting thought, Denise coaching other people. Just in what, exactly, if I might inquire? Is it actually possible to find anyone in this disturbed world who would want to be coached by someone who can do absolutely nothing besides dolling themselves up? In that case, the world must have come to a complete standstill."<br><br> "Mother-" Denise's mother attempted to interrupt.<br><br> "Be quiet, Birgit. Let me finish." She turned toward Denise. "I will be direct. I don't know anyone as lazy, talentless, or with so little sense of reality as you, Denise. Shall we agree that you actually can't do anything? Isn't it high time that you tried to get a job to fit your modest talents?" She waited for an answer, but none was forthcoming. She shook her head, leaving Denise in no doubt as to what was coming next.<br><br> "I have said it before and I have warned you, Denise. Maybe you think it is acceptable to just lie on your back? It's downright shocking. You're not as beautiful as you think, my dear, and certainly won't be in five years, I'm afraid."<br><br> Denise inhaled deeply through her nose. Two more minutes and she'd be out of here.<br><br> Now her grandmother turned to her mother with the same cold, contemptuous expression. "You were the same, Birgit. Thought only of yourself, never doing anything to get on in life. What would you have done without your father and me? If we hadn't paid for everything while you squandered life away in your self-obsessed megalomania?"<br><br> "I have worked, Mother." Her tone was pitiable. It was years since her ammunition of protests hadn't fallen on deaf ears.<br><br> It was now Denise's turn again, as her grandmother turned her attention back toward her, shaking her head.<br><br> "And as for you! You couldn't even get a job folding clothes, if that's what you think."<br><br> Denise turned around and disappeared into the kitchen with the poison from her grandmother trailing behind her.<br><br> If it was possible to see what was inside her grandmother, the ingredients could be laid out in equal measure of intense hatred, vengeance, and unending images of how different she thought everything had once been. Denise had heard the same fake nonsense over and over, and it was irritatingly hurtful every time. About what a good family she and her mother came from; about the golden years when her grandfather had had his shoe shop in R�dovre and earned really good money.<br><br> All a load of crap! Hadn't the women in this family always stayed at home and done their duty? Hadn't they been supported solely by their husbands, been meticulous about their appearance, and looked after the home?<br><br> Hell yes!<br><br> "Mother! You mustn't be too hard on her. She-"<br><br> "Denise is twenty-seven and is good for exactly nothing, Birgit. Nothing!" shouted the witch. "How do you two propose to survive when I'm not here anymore, can you answer me that? Don't for one second expect any significant inheritance from me. I have my own needs."<br><br> Something else they had heard a hundred times before. In a moment she would attack Denise's mother again. She would call her shabby and a failure, before accusing her of passing on all her negative qualities to her granddaughter.<br><br> Denise felt disgust and hatred right to the pit of her stomach. She hated the shrill voice, attacks, and demands. Hated her mother for being so weak and for not having been able to keep a man who could look after them all. Hated her grandmother precisely because that was what she had done.<br><br> Why wouldn't she just lie down and die?<br><br> "I'm out of here," said Denise coldly when she stepped back into the dining room.<br><br> "Oh, are you, now? Well then, you won't be having this." Her grandmother pulled a bundle of notes from her handbag and held it in front of them. One-thousand-kroner notes.<br><br> "Come and sit down now, Denise," her mother implored.<br><br> "Yes, come and sit down for a moment before you go out and sell yourself," came the next tirade from her grandmother. "Eat your mother's awful meal before you head out to find men to ply you with booze. But be careful, Denise, because the way you are, you'll never find a decent man who'll go for you! A cheap girl with fake hair and hair color, fake breasts, fake jewelry, and bad skin. Don't you think they'll see through you in a second, my dear? Or maybe you think a decent man can't tell the difference between elegance and your cheap appearance? Maybe you don't think that as soon as you open your bloodred mouth that he'll immediately discover that you know absolutely nothing and have nothing to say? That you're just a waste of space?"</p><h2>Careless Love : Unmaking of Elvis Presley</h2><p>Last Train to Memphis, the first part of Guralnick&#39;s two-volume life of Elvis Presley, received unprecedented accolades. This concluding volume recounts the second half of Elvis&#39;s life in rich and previously unimagined detail, and confirms Guralnick&#39;s status as one of the great biographers of our time. Beginning with Presley&#39;s army service in Germany in 1958 and ending with his death in Memphis in 1977, Careless Love chronicles the unraveling of the dream that once shone so brightly, homing in on the complex playing-out of Elvis&#39;s relationship with his Machiavellian manager, Colonel Tom Parker. It&#39;s a breathtaking drama that places the events of a too often mistold tale in a fresh, believable, and understandable context. This is the quintessential American story, encompassing race, class, wealth, sex, music, religion, and personal transformation. Written with grace, sensitivity, and passion, Careless Love is a unique contribution to our understanding of American popular culture and the nature of success, giving us true insight at last into one of the most misunderstood public figures of our times.</p><p>Until Peter Guralnick came out with <i>Last Train to Memphis</i> in 1994, most biographies of Elvis Presley--especially those written by people with varying degrees of access to his "inner circle"--were filled with starstruck adulation, and those that weren't in awe of their subject invariably went out of their way to take potshots at the rock &amp; roll pioneer (with Albert Goldman's 1981 <i>Elvis</i> reaching now-legendary levels of bile and condescension). Guralnick's exploration of Elvis's childhood and rise to fame was notable for its factual rigorousness and its intimate appreciation of Presley's musical agenda.<p> Picking up where the first volume left off, Guralnick sees Elvis through his tour of duty with the U.S. Army in Germany, where he first met--and was captivated by--a 14-year-old girl named Priscilla Beaulieu. We may think we know the story from this point: the return to America, the near-decade of B-movies, eventual marriage to Priscilla, a brief flash of glory with the '68 comeback, and the surrealism of "fat Elvis" decked out in bejeweled white jumpsuits, culminating in a bathroom death scene. And while that summary isn't exactly <i>false</i>, Guralnick's account shows how little perspective we've had on Elvis's life until now, how a gross caricature of the final years has come to stand for the life itself. He treats every aspect of Presley's life--including forays into spiritual mysticism and the growing dependency on prescription drugs--with dignity and critical distance. More importantly, <i>Careless Love</i> continues to show that Guralnick "gets" what Presley was trying to do as an artist: "I see him in the same way that I think he saw himself from the start," the introduction states, "as someone whose ambition it was to encompass every strand of the American musical tradition." From rock to blues to country to gospel, Guralnick discusses how, at his finest moments, Elvis was able to fulfill that dream. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>Peter Guralnick is not only an acclaimed biographer but a cultural historian, the author of several famously received books about blues, country and western, and soul music.</p><h2>Dragon&#39;s Keep</h2><p>Far away on Wilde Island, Princess Rosalind is born with a dragon claw where her ring finger should be. To hide the secret, the Queen forces her to wear gloves at all times until a cure can be found,&nbsp;so Rosalind can fulfill the prophecy to restore the family to their rightful throne. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Rosalind&#x2019;s flaw cannot be separated from her fate. When she is carried off by the dragon, everything she thought she knew falls apart. The dragon sees beauty in her talon where her mother saw only shame, and Rosalind finally understands what her mother has truly denied her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carey has written a stunning portrayal of the complex relationship between a mother and daughter in a lyrical novel sure to thrill readers who love fantasy&#x2014;and those who don&#x2019;t.</p><p>Hardcover edition 2007<br>978-0-15-205926-2<br>0-15-205926-1<b>JANET LEE CAREY</b> received the Mark Twain Award in 2005 for <i>Wenny Has Wings</i>.

Four-year-old Laura lives in the little house with her Pa, her Ma, her sisters Mary and Carrie, and their trusty dog, Jack.</p> <p>Pioneer life is sometimes hard, since the family must grow or catch all their own food as they get ready for the cold winter. But it is also exciting as Laura and her folks celebrate Christmas with homemade toys and treats, do the spring planting, bring in the harvest, and make their first trip into town. And every night they are safe and warm in their little house, with the happy sound of Pa's fiddle sending Laura and her sisters off to sleep.</p> <p>And so begins Laura Ingalls Wilder's beloved story of a pioneer girl and her family. The nine Little House books have been cherished by generations of readers as both a unique glimpse into America's frontier past and a heartwarming, unforgettable story. </p></p><p>Although the Little House stories are traditionally seen as "girl" books, boys might be happily surprised if they take another peek at their sisters' shelves. <i>Little House in the Big Woods</i>--the first book of the series and Laura Ingalls Wilder's first children's book--is full of the thrills, chills, and spills typically associated with "boy" books. Any boy or girl who has fantasized about running off to live in the woods will find ample information in these pages to manage a Wisconsin snowstorm, a panther attack, or a wild sled ride with a pig as an uninvited guest. Every chapter divulges fascinatingly intricate, yet easy-to-read, details about pioneer life in the Midwest in the late 1800s, from bear-meat curing to maple-tree sapping to homemade bullet making. <p> Wilder's autobiographical tales ring with truth and excitement. Readers will receive a perfectly painless history lesson, and in fact will clamor for more. Beloved illustrator Garth Williams spent years researching young Laura's pioneering family. His soft-line illustrations bring to life the full, simple days and nights in the family's log cabin. No one can read just one Little House book!

Part private residence, part goldfish bowl, and part national shrine, the White House is both the most important address in America and the most intensely scrutinized. In this splendid blend of the personal and historic, Margaret Truman offers an unforgettable tour of &#x201c;the president&#x2019;s house&#x201d; across the span of two centuries.<br><br>Opened (though not finished) in 1800 and originally dubbed a &#x201c;palace,&#x201d; the White House has been fascinating from day one. In Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s day, it was a reeking construction site where congressmen complained of the hazards of open rubbish pits. Andrew Jackson&#x2019;s supporters, descending twenty thousand strong from the backwoods of Kentucky and Tennessee, nearly destroyed the place during his first inaugural. Teddy Roosevelt expanded it, Jackie Kennedy and Pat Nixon redecorated it. Through all the vicissitudes of its history, the White House has transformed the characters, and often the fates, of its powerful occupants.<br><br>In <i>The President&#x2019;s House</i>, Margaret Truman takes us behind the scenes, into the deepest recesses and onto the airiest balconies, as she reveals what it feels like to live in the White House. Here are hilarious stories of Teddy Roosevelt&#x2019;s rambunctious children tossing spitballs at presidential portraits&#x2013;as well as a heartbreaking account of the tragedy that befell President Coolidge&#x2019;s young son, Calvin, Jr. Here, too, is the real story of the Lincoln Bedroom and the thrilling narrative of how first lady Dolley Madison rescued a priceless portrait of George Washington and a copy of the Declaration of Independence before British soldiers torched the White House in 1814. <br><br>Today the 132-room White House operates as an exotic combination of first-class hotel and fortress, with 1,600 dedicated workers, an annual budget over $1 billion, and a kitchen that can handle anything from an intimate dinner for four to a reception for 2,400. But ghosts of the past still walk its august corridors&#x2013;including a phantom whose visit President Harry S Truman described to his daughter in eerie detail.<br><br>From the basement swarming with reporters to the Situation Room crammed with sophisticated technology to the Oval Office where the president receives the world&#x2019;s leaders, the White House is a beehive of relentless activity, deal-making, intrigue, gossip, and of course history in the making. In this evocative and insightful book, Margaret Truman combines high-stakes drama with the unique perspective of an insider. The ultimate guided tour of the nation&#x2019;s most famous dwelling, <i>The President&#x2019;s House</i> is truly a national treasure.</p><p><b>Margaret Truman</b> has won faithful readers with her works of biography and fiction, including her ongoing series of Capital Crimes mysteries. Her previous bestselling biographies are <i>Harry S Truman</i>, <i>Bess W. Truman</i>, and <i>First Ladies</i>. She lives in Manhattan.<b><br>1<br><br>Magic and Mystery in a Unique Place</b><br>The last time I was in Washington, D.C., I walked by the White House on the way to dinner at a nearby restaurant. Hidden floodlights made the historic building glow like a mansion in a vision or a dream. Suddenly I thought: I am not the woman who lived in that house more than fifty years ago. She is a completely different person. I barely know her.<br><br>The words whispered in my mind like a voice from another world. I was remembering, or trying to remember, what it meant to be the daughter of the president of the United States, living in that shining shimmering house. The one inescapable thing I recalled was the difference. I have lived in several houses and apartments, and spent some time in splendid establishments, including a few royal palaces. But not one of them--or all of them together--can compare to the feeling I recalled from my White House days.<br><br>That was when I resolved to write this book about one of the most mysterious, terrifying, exalting, dangerous, fascinating houses in the world. It is a house that has changed people in amazing, unexpected ways. It is a house that has broken hearts and minds. It is a house that has made some people weep when they walked out the door for the last time--and others feel like escapees from a maximum security prison. Some marriages have been saved within those pristine white walls. Others have been irrevocably ruined.<br><br>Children have played marvelously clever games inside and outside this unique piece of architecture. Other children have twisted and turned in their death throes while their weeping parents, arguably the most powerful persons on the North American continent, clutched them in their impotent arms. In those same second-floor bedrooms, radiant brides have dressed in virginal white and descended to meet loving husbands as the world applauded.<br><br>Once, one of these brides married a president. I am speaking of Frances Folsom and Grover Cleveland. A century or so ago, when I was a twenty-something, I had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Cleveland, who told me the reason she was married in the White House instead of in her family home: Nowhere else could she and the president have their privacy guaranteed.<br><br>The old house is, to put it mildly, a paradoxical place. People who think in straight lines have a very difficult time adjusting to it. And as history has shown again and again, many of them never do. Even so, I think everyone who has ever lived in the White House would agree that it's a special experience--a unique combination of history, tragedy, comedy, melodrama, and the ups and downs of ordinary living all under one roof.<br><b><br>II</b><br>Men bearing that unique title, president of the United States, the office my father called "the greatest in the history of the world," have paced the White House's darkened halls in periods of national crisis, gazing at portraits of their predecessors on the walls, seeking communion with their triumphs--or shuddering at their blunders. Women reached out to these men, trying to offer them guidance, or at the very least solace for their awesome burdens. My mother managed to play both roles in my father's presidency--a feat too many obtuse historians and biographers have failed to recognize.<br><br>In the basement and attic rooms are the memories of the hundreds of other people who lived a large part of their working lives in this unique house, and experienced its aura of power and history. Their stories belong in this book, too. Some, I regret to say, were slaves. But the house, paradoxical as always, gradually became a place where free African-Americans demonstrated their right to equality.<br><br>Maggie Rogers began working as a White House maid when William Howard Taft became president in 1909. Her daughter, Lillian Rogers Parks, was hired as a seamstress at the White House in 1929 and worked until the end of the Eisenhower administration in 1961. Growing up, Lillian once asked her mother if she would be happier (and better paid) at some millionaire's mansion elsewhere in the capital. Maggie Rogers scorned the idea. "Heavens no, child! Be it ever so elegant, there's no place like the White House. Why, I'm living history!" There was black pride and White House pride achieving a magical fusion.<br><br>Also worth commemorating are the efforts of the dedicated, courageous, amazingly patient men who have struggled to keep presidents and their families alive in the often malevolent glare of public criticism and spasms of national hatred. We know them now as members of the Secret Service. But their predecessors are equally memorable, standing guard at the White House's doors in suits that were a size too large for them--to conceal their pistols. Most people, including some of the presidents they guarded, were unaware of those hidden weapons.<br><br>There is a side to these protectors that few people know about, much less appreciate--the many acts of kindness and thoughtfulness they perform for presidents and first ladies. Perhaps the most touching story comes from the sad days of President Woodrow Wilson's decline. Felled by a stroke, he sank into near despair as Congress rejected his dream of world peace embodied in the League of Nations.<br><br>When the crippled president went for a ride in the afternoon, the Secret Service used to round up a small crowd of government employees and strolling tourists, who waited at the White House gate to cheer him when he returned. It was a pathetic illusion, but a testament to how much these men cared about the president.<br><b><br>III<br></b><br>Perhaps the most intriguing White House denizens are the men and women who have worked beside presidents as their spokespersons or confidential advisers. More than anyone, they often shared the reflected glow of White House power. Not all of them were able to deal with it rationally or responsibly, though the vast majority have managed it. For many of them, the experience was more than a little harrowing--and in a few cases, fatal.<br><br>I am thinking of one of my most heartbreaking White House memories--the death of my father's boyhood friend and press secretary, Charlie Ross. Charlie went through high school with Harry Truman and went on to become a top-ranked Washington, D.C., reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. When my father turned to him for help in 1945, Charlie gave up a comfortable salary and rational hours for the ordeal of a White House in which clocks and sensible schedules ceased to exist. Five exhausting years later, during the frantic early months of the Korean War, when newsmen besieged the White House twenty-four hours a day, Charlie Ross collapsed and died of a heart attack at his desk. A weeping Harry Truman said the country had lost a great public servant--and he had lost his best friend.<br><b><br>IV</b><br>That memory leads us to another cadre of White House inhabitants, although many presidents and their families might be reluctant to bestow that title on them: the men and women of the media. They, too, participate in the aura of the White House--to the point where they sometimes act as if they run the place. I had a vivid reminder of this mind-set when I came to the White House to talk with Hillary Clinton in 1994 about my book in progress, First Ladies.<br><br>A badly misinformed White House policeman told me to enter the mansion through the press briefing room in the West Wing. The minute I stepped through the doorway, a half dozen reporters surrounded me. Why was I there? To advise Hillary on how to improve her performance as First Lady? What did I think of Hillary's latest hairstyle? Should she hold more press conferences ^ la Eleanor Roosevelt, or fewer ^ la Bess Truman (who held none at all)? I smiled sweetly and said "No comment" to these attempts to get me to put my foot in my mouth.<br><br>My favorite White House media story comes from my friend President Gerald Ford. Gerry says he and veteran newswoman Helen Thomas were strolling on a street near the White House when he saw one of those old-fashioned scales that gave you your fortune and weight for a penny. Gerry read the little fortune card aloud: "You are a marvelous orator and leader of men. Your future in your chosen career could not be brighter."<br><br>Helen, looking over his shoulder, said: "It's got your weight wrong, too."<br><br>As the wife (now widow) of a newspaperman, I recognize the necessity for such irreverence. As the daughter of a president, I don't have to like it. But I am prepared to include it, somewhat ruefully, in the White House's story.<br><b><br>V</b><br>The White House is far more than the place where presidents and hundreds of staffers work and presidential families live. It is also the place where America's pride and dignity as a sovereign nation are displayed. At official dinners and receptions, when the president enters the room to the U.S. Marine Band's resounding "Hail to the Chief," people recognize not only a powerful man but the nation, the United States of America. The immense amount of time and effort that presidents and first ladies and the White House staff devote to entertaining visitors from around the country and the world is a fascinating and important story. It, too, is part of the White House aura.<br><br>What a roster these visitors constitute! They range from the king and queen of England, whose snobbish servants started an uncivil war with the White House staff, to Russian grand dukes and Japanese noblemen, from world renowned politicians such as Winston Churchill, who gave himself a mild heart attack trying to open his bedroom window, to Cherokee and Creek and Sioux Indian chiefs, who did war dances on the lawn. Marvelous musicians such as pianist Vladimir Horowitz, soprano Jessye Norman, and cellist Pablo Casals (who performed for the Theodore Roosevelts in 1901 and for the John F. Kennedys sixty years later) have filled presidential ears with beautiful music. Entertainers such as Frank Sinatra and Barbra Streisand...</p><h2>Union with Christ: John Calvin and the Mysticism of St. Bernard (Columbia Series in Reformed Theology)</h2><p><p>This fascinating volume explores the mystical strand of thought that exists in the writings of John Calvin.

But with the in-your-face competition, the irresistible Trevor starts to see Chastity as more than a friend....<br><br>Originally published in 2008. <em></em><br><br></p><p>Kristan Higgins is the New York Times, Publishers Weekly and USA TODAY bestselling author whose books have been translated into more than twenty languages.

I inhale sharply, and the stuffed mushroom I just popped in my mouth is sucked right into my esophagus. Jason continues, unaware of my distress. "It's run its course, don't you think? I mean, it's not like we've..."</p><p>Seems like my little old air passage is completely plugged. My eyes are tearing, my chest convulses&#x2014;<i>Before you break up with me, Jason, would you mind a little Heimlich? </i>I slam my hand down on the table, rattling the china and cutlery, but Jason assumes that my distress is heartbreak and not oxygen deprivation. He looks away.</p><p>I'm being killed by my appetizer. I knew I shouldn't have ordered it, but Emo makes the little number drenched in butter, with little bits of garlic and parsley and...um... <i>Must breathe now. Save food review for later. </i>The pressure in my neck is building. I make a fist, wedge it just below my sternum, and slam myself into the table. The mushroom shoots out, hits a water glass and comes to a rest on the white tablecloth. I suck in an enormous breath, then begin coughing.</p><p>Jason eyes the mushroom with distaste, and without thinking, I grab it, stuff it in a napkin and take another beautiful gulp of air. Breathing. It's so underrated.</p><p>"I was choking, you idiot," I manage to wheeze.</p><p>"Oh. Sorry about that. Well, good thing you're okay."</p><p>It's hard for me to believe that I was even dating Jason to begin with, let alone the fact that he's dumping me. Dumping <i>me! </i>I should be dumping <i>him! </i></p><p>I glance at the wadded-up napkin containing the instrument of my near death. The poor busboy who has to deal with that. Should I warn him? Otherwise, he'll shake it out, innocent, unaware, and the unchewed mushroom will fly across the kitchen, sliding on the floor, maybe getting squashed under a shoe....</p><p><i>Focus, Chastity, focus. You're being dumped. At least find out why. </i>"So, Jason, that's fine. I mean, clearly it wasn't love at first sight. But other than that, do you mind telling me...well, why?"</p><p>Jason, whom I have been seeing for about three weeks, takes an impervious sip of wine and stares over my head. "Do we have to dissect this, Chastity?"</p><p>"Well, um...think of it as my desire to gain information. I <i>am </i>a journalist, remember." I try a friendly smile, but I'm not feeling so chummy right now. Or ever, now that I think of it. At least, not toward Jason.</p><p>"Do you really want to know?"</p><p>"Yes, actually, I do." I pause, feeling a flush prickle its way up my chest. Our brief relationship has been tepid at best, but I thought the malaise was emanating from me. More than anything, this is a matter of wounded pride. Jason and I have been on four dates now. He lives in Albany, and it's a bit of a hassle to make the drive, and sometimes neither of us is feeling that inspired. Still, I didn't see this coming.</p><p>Jason's tongue is searching for something near a back molar. His mouth contorts as his cheek bulges. I find myself hoping he'll choke, too. Seems only fair. His eyes still don't bother to meet mine. "Fine," he acquiesces, leaving whatever morsel lurks at the back of his mouth for later enjoyment. "You want to hear the reason? I just don't find you attractive enough. Sorry."</p><p>My mouth drops open yet again. "Not attractive! Not attract&#x2014; I'm very attractive!"</p><p>Jason rolls his eyes. "Sure. A handsome woman. Whatever. And with shoulders like those, you could find work down on the docks."</p><p>"I row!" I protest. "I'm strong! That's supposed to be sexy."</p><p>"Yes, well, proving that you could pick me up didn't exactly set my libido on fire."</p><p>"We were horsing around!" I cry. It was, in fact, the one lighthearted moment in our courtship...we'd been hiking, he complained that he was tired, I took over. End of story.</p><p>"You gave me a piggyback ride for a mile and a half, Chastity. That's something a Sherpa should do, not a girlfriend."</p><p>"It wasn't my fault that you couldn't manage a measly twelve-mile trail!"</p><p>"And another thing. You yell."</p><p>"I do not yell!" I yell, then catch myself. "I have four brothers," I say primly and much more quietly. "It's not always easy to make oneself heard."</p><p>"Look. Is there any point in this?" Jason asks. "I'm sorry. I just don't find you that attractive, Chastity."</p><p>"Fine. For that matter, I think you need to bathe more often, Jason. This whole Seattle-grunge-patchouli thing is so 1990s." It's not a bad comeback, but my face is burning nonetheless.</p><p>"Whatever. Here." Taking out his wallet, he puts a few bills on the table. "This should cover my half. Take care of yourself." He slides out of the booth.</p><p>"Jason?" I say.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"You throw like a girl."</p><p>He rolls his eyes and walks out.</p><p>I don't care, do I? It's not like he was The One. He was just an experiment, just a toe-dip into the dating pool of upstate New York. The good thing is, I don't have to look at his freckled, hairless legs any more. At least I won't have to watch him cut his food into tiny, tiny bites that he chews relentlessly until they are merely flavored saliva. Won't have to hear that funny nose whistle he has all the time and is completely unaware of. He was only five foot ten to boot, almost two inches shorter than my superfox self.</p><p>Superfox. Right. I shove my mushrooms away&#x2014;who's hungry now?&#x2014;and drain my wineglass. <i>Not attractive. </i>Jerk. How dare he say that? It's not like he was George bleeping Clooney, either! Just a skinny, pale, mop-haired dweeb who happened to ask me out. <i>He </i>initiated contact! I didn't throw myself at him. I didn't kidnap him. There were no bags over heads, no handcuffs, no long rides in the trunk of my car. I did <i>not </i>have to dig a pit in my basement and chain him there. Why am I suddenly not attractive?</p><p>This means nothing, I tell myself. Jason meant nothing. It's just that he was the first guy I'd dated since moving back to my hometown. And, now that I think of it, the first guy I've dated in...um...crap. A long time. So Jason was, well, the frog I was kissing. I want to settle down, sure. Maybe I'm feeling a little under the gun to get married and spawn the four babies I always wanted.</p><p>I'm almost thirty-one years old, and these are the ugly years for women like me. What happened to all those guys in my mid-twenties? In grad school? At the paper? There must be some line that we women cross. College, grad school, just starting out in a job...we're a blast then. A few years of career under our belt...watch out, boys! She's awantin' a ring!</p><p>I glance furtively around the restaurant, hoping for a distraction. Emo's is packed tonight&#x2014;families, couples of all ages, friends. My newly dumped status seems broadcast throughout the restaurant. It's better than being with Jason, actually, but still. I'm the only person here alone. Emo's&#x2014;a place so often visited by my family that we have a booth named after us&#x2014;is half bar, half restaurant, separated by double French doors. The bar, I can see, is packed. My belovedYankees are playing at home. They've won their first five games of the season. Why, I wonder, did I agree to go out with Jason when I could be watching Derek Jeter instead?</p><p>Without further thought, I leave the booth, the site of my humiliation and near-death episode, wave to the waitress to alert her to the change of venue and go into the bar.</p><p>"Hey, Chas!" Several men&#x2014;Jake, Santo, Paul, George&#x2014; chorus my name, and my battered ego is mollified somewhat. Having four older brothers, two of whom are Eaton Falls firefighters alongside my father, a captain, ensures that I know just about every local male under the age of fifty. Unfortunately, this has done nothing for me thus far on the boyfriend front, since there seems to be a law against dating the O'Neill girl&#x2014;me.</p><p>"Hello, there, Chastity," says Stu, the bartender.</p><p>"Hi, Stu. How about...um..."</p><p>"Bud Light?" he suggests, my usual drink.</p><p>"Nah. How about a Scorpion Bowl? Okay?"</p><p>Stu pauses. "You sure? They're not really just for one person."</p><p>"I'm walking home. It's fine. I need it, Stu. Oh, and some nachos, too, please. Better make it grande."</p><p>Ifindanempty stool andturnmyattentiontothe Bronx Bombers. The mighty Jeter makes a trademark twisting leap, snags the ball, then tags out the runner who was foolish enough to assume it was safe to leave second base. Double play, thank you, Derek. At least something's going right tonight.</p><p>Stu puts my drink in front of me, and I take a large gulp, then grimace. Stupid Jason. I wish I'd dumped him before he dumped me. I knew he wasn't the one I'd end up with, but I was hoping to like him more as time went on. Hoping for some hidden qualities to seep out from his pallid, freckled skin and eradicate the sneaking suspicion that I was dating him because I had no one better to be with.</p><p>Didn't happen. Another gulp from the Scorpion Bowl burns down my throat. <i>Don't worry about that jerk, </i>the Scorpion Bowl seems to say. <i>He was icky, anyway. </i>Yes. True, Scorpion Bowl. But he did beat me to the breakup punch. Damn.</p><p>"Here you go, Chastity," Stu&#x2014;six feet even&#x2014;says, setting down the nacho mountain in front of me. Cheese oozes off the sides, jalape�os are glommed on top of a cloud of sour cream, and suddenly, I'm starving, the mushroom mishap forgotten.</p><p>"Thanks, Stu." I pull off a hunk of nachos and take a bite. Heaven. Another swallow of hideous drink. Not so bad this time, not with a nacho chaser, and a pleasant buzz fuzzes my brain. Good old Scorpy. Haven't had one since an ill-advised college drinking party, but I'm starting to remember why they were so popular back then.</p><p>The inning is over, and a commercial comes on. Taking another bite and another slug of my drink, I glance back out at the restaurant. Through the French doors at the table nearest the bar sits a good-looking man. Though I can't quite see his companion, her hair is white, making me think she's his mother, possibly his boss. He really is handsome in that perfect and somewhat sterile <i>New York Times Magazine </i>way...prep school rich, full lips, long, flopping McDreamy-style blond h...</p></p><h2>Alexis Lichine&#39;s Guide to the Wines and Vineyards</h2><p>Stated First Edition in original dust jacket.

Lewis: The Pilgrim&#39;s Regress, Christian Reflections, God in the Dock</h2><p>The writer of popular works such as <em>The Chronicles of Narnia </em>series for children has also touched the world with his biographical journey to Christianity. Lewis was a profound thinker with the rare ability to communicate the philosophical and theological rationale of Christianity in simple yet amazingly effective ways. In <em>The Pilgrim's Regress, </em>Lewis records his search for meaning and spiritiual satisfaction that eventually led him to Christianity. <em>God in the Dock </em>contains forty-eight essays and twelve letters that cover topics as varied as the logic of theism, good and evil, miracles, and ethics. And in <em>Christian Reflections, </em>he addresses Christianity and literature, Christianity and culture, petitionary prayer, modern theology, and biblical criticism.</p><p><p>Clive Staples Lewis was born in 1898. Known as "Jack" by his friends, Lewis and his good friend J.R.R. Tolkien, the author of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, were part of a writer's club, The Inklings, who would meet at the local pub to discuss story ideas. Lewis's fascination with fairytales, myths, and ancient legends coupled with inspiration drawn from his childhood led him to write The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, one of the best-loved books of all time. Six further books in the immensely popular Chronicles of Narnia followed, and the final title, The Last Battle, received the Carnegie Award, one of the highest marks of excellence in children's literature.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Xandau Talisman (Modesty Blaise)</h2><p>In this classic return we see Modesty both at her most feminine and at her toughest. Trapped in an earthquake disaster with a dying man, she makes a promise that is to lead her and her faithful friend Willie Garvin into the most perilous crisis of their careers. Their quest takes them from Tangier to Paris, from the Riviera to Corsica, and finally to a stronghold in the heart of the Atlas Mountains, their every move observed and manipulated by El Mico, the most notorious and dangerous criminal genius in the Mediterranean. Unknown to Modesty, she holds a secret that El Mico covets above all else, and she is brought to a final confrontation with death in the stronghold of Xanadu. As in all the Modesty Blaise stories, this book is peopled with a host of eccentric characters: the engaging Dr. Giles Pennyfeather, Modesty&#39;s devoted friend, and her opponents Little Krell, a prodigy in combat, the Silk brothers, juvenile adults who deal in death, and the astonishing Nanny Prendergast.</p><p><b>Peter O'Donnell</b> created the Modesty Blaise strip cartoon in the 1950s and is the author of 13 books in the Modesty Blaise novel series.<br>&#x201c;[Modesty Blaise and Willie Gavin's is] one of the greatest partnerships in crime fiction . . . bearing comparison (though necessarily different from) that of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;Kingsley Amis</p><h2>Good and Evil: Interpreting a Human Condition</h2><p>Good and Evil: Interpreting a Human Condition [Paperback] [Nov 01, 1990] Farl...</p><p>Edward Farley is Professor Emeritus of Theology at Vanderbilt Divinity School in Nashville, Tennessee.

Little about Satie was conventional, and he resists classification under easy headings such as &#39;classical music&#39;. Instead of pursuing the path of a professional composer, Satie initially earned a living as a caf� pianist and moved in bohemian circles which prized satire, popular culture and experiment. Small wonder that his music is fundamentally new in conception. It is music which is not always designed to be listened to attentively: music which can be machine-like but is to be played by humans. For Satie, music was part of a wider concept of artistic creation, as evidenced by his collaborations with leading avant-garde artists and in works which cross traditional genre boundaries such as his texted piano pieces. His music was created in some of the most exciting and creatively stimulating environments of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century: Montmartre and Montparnasse. Paris was the artistic centre of Europe, and Satie was a notorious figure whose music and ideas are inextricably linked with the City of Light. This book situates Satie&#39;s work within the context and sonic environment of contemporary Paris. It shows that the influence of street music, musicians and poets interested in new technology, contemporary innovations and radical politics are all crucial to an understanding of Satie. Music from the ever-popular Gymnop�dies to newly discovered works are discussed, and an online supplement features rare pieces recorded especially for the book.

Labor activist and scholar of the American labor movement Stanley Aronowitz argues that the movement as we have known it for the last 100 years is effectively dead. And he explains how this death has been a long time coming&#x2014;the organizing and political principles adopted by US unions at mid-century have taken a terrible toll. In the 1950s, Aronowitz was a factory metalworker.<p>In the &#x2019;50s and &#x2019;60s, he directed organizing with the Amalgamated Clothing Workers and the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers. In 1963, he coordinated the labor participation for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Ten years later, the publication of his book <i>False Promises: The Shaping of American Working Class Consciousness </i>was a landmark in the study of the US working-class and workers&#x2019; movements.</p><p>Aronowitz draws on this long personal history, reflecting on his continuing involvement in labor organizing, with groups such as the Professional Staff Congress of the City University. He brings a historian&#x2019;s understanding of American workers&#x2019; struggles in taking the long view of the labor movement. Then, in a survey of current initiatives, strikes, organizations, and allies, Aronowitz analyzes the possibilities of labor&#x2019;s rebirth, and sets out a program for a new, broad, radical workers&#x2019; movement.</p></p><p><b>Stanley Aronowitz</b> has taught at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York since 1983, where he is Distinguished Professor of Sociology and Urban Education, and where he is Director of the Center for the Study of Culture, Technology and Work. He is author or editor of twenty-five books and is founding editor of the journal <i>Social Text.</i>&#x201c;Stanley Aronowitz is the most important scholar on the past and present US working class.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Cornel West, author (with Tavis Smiley) of <i>The Rich and the Rest of Us</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Four decades after <i>False Promises</i>, his classic study of class consciousness, Stanley Aronowitz stirringly returns to questions of work, power, and inequality in this exciting study. Steeped in historical knowledge, theoretical insight, and movement experience, <i>The Death and Life of American Labor </i>sustains a remarkable combination of sober reflection and grounded hope for a new workers&#x2019; movement, one without unions always at its center. It shows how the exhaustion of liberalism and the perils of climate change, temporary work, and new technologies both necessitate and foster fresh approaches.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;David Roediger, author of <i>Seizing Freedom</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Nothing less than a brilliantly argued demand for the labor movement to shed its ill-conceived twentieth-century &#x2018;partnership&#x2019; garb with Capital and the Democratic Party and reinvent itself in the twenty-first century ...

In 2008 she published The Host, her first novel for adults, which was a number one bestseller around the world and has sold nine million copies. It was released as a feature film in 2013. She lives with her husband and three sons in Arizona.Praise for <i>The Chemist:</i><br><br>"This espionage action story will no doubt tighten Meyer's grip on her devoted readers. Its main character is much like Jason Bourne, to whom the novel is dedicated affectionately.... Meyer knows how to control dramatic tension as skillfully as any of the Bourne movies. The pages turn themselves."&#x2015;<b>Keith Donohue</b>, <b><i>Washington Post</i></b><br><br><em></em> "Engrossing.... A terrific ride.... <em>The Chemist</em> is consistently fast-paced fun, especially the way that Alex's scientific genius gives her an array of potions-she's small, but you don't want to get within swiping distance of the rings on her fingers-that verge on the magical."&#x2015;<b>Charles Finch</b>, <b><i>USA Today</i></b><br><br>"Fans will likely tear through <em>The Chemist</em>, just as they did with the <em>Twilight</em> novels and with <em>The Host</em>.... Our heroine is very good at staying alive.... The book hit on an appealing theme. Chris is an expert in her field, one that happens to be male dominated. Her peers are out to get her. She has to watch her back constantly.... With so many popular novels out there featuring unreliable female narrators stuck in various suburbs, it was nice to read about a woman who gets out and has a lot to do."&#x2015;<b>Meredith Goldstein</b>, <b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>"[Meyer has] an unusual ability to turn genres inside out. The characters in the novel are motivated by love of family rather than by duty to country or abstractions like saving the world. Love gives the adventure meaning, rather than just being a subplot off to the side.

Islands, he shows, have always sparked the imagination with notions of danger, adventure, isolation and even perfection. They have lured explorers and been the reason for battles between colonizing empires. Islands have given birth to unique cultures, they have prompted scientists and anthropologists with clues to human beginnings, and have been known to occasionally disappear without a trace. Gillis unravels both the actual and conceptual history of islands, beginning with the imagined lands of Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> and ending with a look at modern-day cruise destinations. This multifaceted survey shows how and why islands have occupied such a central place in the western imagination, and how they came to be master symbols and inexhaustible metaphors for so many different things.<br></p><p>"The island of the mind is not just an object of passive contemplation. It has been an incentive to action, an agent of history.... Islands of the mind continue to be extraordinarily valuable symbolic resources, a treasure trove of images through which the west understands itself and its relations with the larger world."--From the Introduction<br><br>In <i>Islands of the Mind</i>, John R.

From the classical archipelagos of the Aegean, via the mythic marvels of Atlantis, to today's desert island hideaways, John Gillis brilliantly illumines our earthly stars and starlets--a ocean galaxy almost as manifold as and even more fabulous than the constellations in the skies above. This stunning story of humanity's love-and-hate affair with all these specks in the silver sea sums up the meanings and the motives that have impelled countless generations to discover, settle, reshape, and often invent islands. In delightful prose, John Gillis tells us why we love or loathe them, all the ways they spur our imagination, and how castaways and paradise seekers from Odysseus and Caliban to Robinson Crusoe and Peter Pan have been transformed by them. This book will be cherished by everyone who has ever been enchanted by islands."<br>--David Lowenthal, author of <i>The Past Is a Foreign Country</i><br><br>"'The less they are occupied,&#x2019; John Gillis concludes his dazzling survey of the meaning of the island in western civilization, &#x2018;the more they preoccupy us.' With characteristic precision and penetration, that says it all: the island has dominated the western imagination since the Bronze Age. Each island exists in the mind before it is known on the horizon. It is, more than any other form of land or landscape, the realm of possibility, the place in which the full, the rich, the holy, and the seductive can all be imagined as the ultimately real. With a comprehensiveness and an alluring lightness of touch, Professor Gillis has pinned this most slippery archipelago of the mind to its true place on the chart of cultural history."--Adam Nicolson, author of<i>Sea Room, God&#x2019;s Secretaries,</i> and <i>Seamanship</i><br></p><h2>Huggly&#39;s Big Mess</h2><p>Huggly learned to love pizza in his birthday party adventure, Huggly and the Toy Monster.

Maryland's Vanishing Lives is his vivid account of the people he met on those journeys. Working in a country store or an old-time movie house, on a small tobacco farm or a weathered skipjack, Sherwood's subjects interest us as people, as stubborn survivors who have watched -- sometimes defiantly, sometimes wistfully -- as the world moved on.</p><p>These Marylanders' stories poignantly show what happens to family businesses and ordinary folk in the face of new technology, suburban sprawl, franchise outlets, and changing tastes. But Maryland's Vanishing Lives is also an engaging celebration of pride and craft, and the ability to survive.

A handsome collection of essays and photographs that celebrates the lives of pigeon racers and elevator operators, oyster packers and barrel makers, sailmakers and boat builders, fishermen and blacksmiths.

She looks in the mirror and sees an unfamiliar, middle-aged face. And every morning, the man she has woken up with must explain that he is Ben, he is her husband, she is forty-seven years old, and a terrible accident two decades earlier decimated her ability to form new memories. But it&#39;s the phone call from a Dr. Nash, a neurologist who claims to be working with Christine without her husband&#39;s knowledge, that directs her to her journal, hidden in the back of her closet. For the past few weeks, Christine has been recording her daily activities -- tearful mornings with Ben, sessions with Dr. Nash, flashes of scenes from her former life -- and rereading past entries, relearning the facts of her life as retold by the husband she is completely dependent upon. As the entries build up, Christine asks many questions. What was life like before the accident? Why did she and Ben never have a child? What has happened to Christine&#39;s best friend? And what exactly was the horrific accident that caused such a profound loss of memory? Every day, Christine must begin again the reconstruction of her past. And the closer she gets to the truth, the more unbelievable it seems.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, June 2011</strong>: Every day Christine wakes up not knowing where she is. Her memories disappear every time she falls asleep. Her husband, Ben, is a stranger to her, and he's obligated to explain their life together on a daily basis--all the result of a mysterious accident that made Christine an amnesiac. With the encouragement of her doctor, Christine starts a journal to help jog her memory every day. One morning, she opens it and sees that she's written three unexpected and terrifying words: "Don't trust Ben." Suddenly everything her husband has told her falls under suspicion. What kind of accident caused her condition? Who can she trust? Why is Ben lying to her? And, for the reader: Can Christine&#x2019;s story be trusted? At the heart of S. J. Watson's <em>Before I Go To Sleep </em>is the petrifying question: How can anyone function when they can't even trust themselves? Suspenseful from start to finish, the strength of Watson's writing allows <em>Before I Go to Sleep</em> to transcend the basic premise and present profound questions about memory and identity. One of the best debut literary thrillers in recent years, <em>Before I Go to Sleep</em> deserves to be one of the major blockbusters of the summer. <em>--Miriam Landis</em><p>International Bestseller</p><p>Now a major motion picture starring Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth</p><p>Memories define us.

He has since gained enormous popular and critical acclaim for both his mainstream and his science fiction novels.Banks has woven a warm and funny story, rich with characters and adventures. An utterly enchanting piece of fiction...it marks a return to his brilliant best. NEW WOMAN This is Bank s&#39; finest novel yet. INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY Hip and sexy humour...Bank reinforces his credentials as one of the most able, energetic and stimulating writers we have in the UK. TIME OUT The Crow Road is tight with detail and closer observation and creates a strong sense of a particular period of growing up. THE INDEPENDENT Magic is the book&#39;s keynote. It echoes in descriptions of evolution that pass from the factual to the elegiac and on the mythical. It calls most insistently when intensity - of love, lust or grief - burst through limited expectations or circumstances to release poetry. THE TIMES Banks keeps death in its place, under the boot of wit which knows that the most significant romance can blossom whilst your youngest brother is up to the elbow in Sugar Smacks looking for the plastic toy. OBSERVER The tense horror of the book...is done with considerable imaginative subtlety and a fine touch...This is as fine and ambitious a novel as any from a Scottish writer since the 1960s. It is also unquestionable Bank&#39;s best work to date. NEW STATESMAN A magnificent, rambling family saga...his best novel yet.

Author Erik Larson re-creates the events leading up to the disaster in astonishing detail, tracing the thoughts and actions of Isaac Cline, a scientist with America's burgeoning U.S. Weather Bureau. Cline's unwavering confidence--"In an age of scientific certainty one could not allow one's judgment to be clouded..."--blinds the meteorologist to the deadly onslaught about to be unleashed. Herrmann's calculated performance reflects the impending doom and dangers inherent to an unquestioned and absolute faith in science.

Erik Larson's writing is luminous, the story absolutely gripping.

In her penetrating study of three distinct generations of Boston priests in the late nineteenth century, the author shows that Irish Catholicism met with steady opposition. Her account of the struggle of Boston clerics and intellectuals to relate their faith to their experiences in the changing city provides a new interpretation of Boston Catholic culture. </p><p> In the 1840s Catholic influence in Boston was minimal and, therefore, accepted. The clergy, like other Bostonians, took pride in the city's history and colonial traditions. In measuring the impact of the massive Irish-Catholic immigration of the 1850s upon this first group of priests, the author traces in part the desperate efforts of Archbishop John J. Williams to maintain Boston's genteel traditions. The character of the clergy changed from the first generation, in which priests wrote novels and radical editorials, to a second generation, in which the influence of European Catholicism was strengthened. Immigrant priests and their Irish parishioners eventually outnumbered the Yankee Catholics, but they nevertheless failed to win genuine leadership in the diocese. </p><p> A third group of priests, emerging in the 1890s under the leadership of Cardinal William O'Connell, displaced not only two generations of clergymen, but also two ways of life: one which sought to leave a legacy of admiration for the Boston Protestant heritage, and one which never understood Boston and tried to replace its cultural ways with something Irish, European, and Jansenistic. O'Connell, who had the Progressive's instinct for organization, imposed a kind of intellectual martial law on the clergy which discouraged, even punished, nonconformity. It is only at this point that it becomes reasonable to consider the traditional view that Boston Catholic thought is monolithic. </p></p><p></p><h2>The Ciba Collection of Medical Illustrations Vol. 3, Pt. 2 : Digestive System: Lower Digestive Tract</h2><p>This volume of the magnificent series of the major anatomy and pathology of the systems of the human organism illustrated by Dr. Netter is a fine example of the high quality of this series. The illustrations are beautifully reproduced with great clarity. The drawings attempt the difficult task of illustration of the relationship between form and function and succeed well in graphically portraying present concepts of upper gastrointestinal physiology. The charts on mastication, vomiting, hunger and deglutition are particularly excellent examples of the graphic arts in the explanation of such complex processes. The text accompanying the illustrations is succinct, precise and well written.</p><p></p><h2>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Dordogne, Bordeaux &amp; the Southwest Coast</h2><p><p><i>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Dordogne, Bordeaux, and the Southwest Coast</i> will lead you straight to the best attractions this romantic region of France has to offer.

Become mayor of New York, of course. Mitchell Hundred gave up crimefighting years ago, and now fights evil with a pen and a mayoral seal. His mysterious power still comes in handy, though, especially when he can make the paparazzis' cameras jam or the neighbor's air conditioner stop rattling. But ever since his attempt to help fend off the September 11th attacks forced him to reveal his secret identity, things have gotten terribly complicated for Hundred. In this second volume we see him struggling with a political firestorm ignited by his open support of gay marriage at the same time that a mysterious presence is terrorizing New York's subways, leaving behind the horribly mutilated bodies of dogs and humans. Beside each gruesome discovery is a glyph linked to the explosion that gave Hundred his power. Vaughan (<i>Y: The Last Man</i>) and Harris (<i>Starman</i> series) have a created a compelling and completely original hero in Mitch Hundred. Ex Machina is half <i>X-Files</i>, half <i>West Wing</i> and 100% genius. The dialogue sparkles, the art beautifully conveys both Vaughan's horror and his humor, and the plot twists will have readers on the edge of their seats. For any fan of contemporary comics, <i>Ex Machina </i>is the series to read. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Grade 10 Up In this fast-paced and often sexy collection of previously published individual comics, a former superhero runs for and wins the mayoralty of New York City. Mitchell Hundred, who as Mr. Hundred could speak to machines, is now the boyish young mayor dealing with a series of gruesome subway stabbings. Besides that, he is planning to officiate at the wedding of two men, and his glamorous young staffers are warning him that it will make him unpopular in the polls. To deflect that, he takes a voluptuous columnist up on her dinner-date offer. Otherwise, he spends his time alone in a hovel apartment, dressing up in what must be the ugliest superhero costume ever, trying to sort out the subway killings. There are writing gaps here; it seems as though the monthly comics don't flow together as one book as well as they should. But the action delivers, and when it comes it's bold and leaves readers with a sense of awe. Also, the incipient love affair between the mayor and the columnist is appealing. Most early new series need to shake out the kinks, and this one seems headed nowhere but up. Strong language makes the book most appropriate for public libraries.<i> John Leighton, Brooklyn Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Here they see Indians and Ladinos living side by side following centuries-old traditions, each with their own interpretation of Catholicism and a symbolic language that distinguishes their culture and customs.</p><p>This book documents a fast-disappearing tradition of iron crosses as house blessings as collected by the late Frans Blom, now located at Na Bolom, the Museum and Cultural Center established in 1960 in San Crist�bal de Las Casas. By extending her purview from this collection to the more than two hundred extant crosses of iron, wood, and cement that are still visible on roofs of San Crist�bal, Guess presents a wealth of information that traces the tradition from its origins, identifies stylistic variations that occur among these roof crosses, and provides interpretations of the symbols that adorn them. <p>In a series of walking tours the author guides readers through the streets of the old barrios where the crosses still can be viewed.

And that the author is no ordinary author. Matthew Dunn spent 5 years as a field operative in SIS recruiting and running agents, planning and participating in special operations and operating deep undercover throughout the world. In SPARTAN, Dunn&#39;s explosive debut, he draws on his unique background to breathe dynamic new life into the contemporary spy novel. Featuring super-spy Will Cochrane, Dunn paints a nerve-shredding, stunningly suthentic picture of today&#39;s secret world. It&#39;s a place where trust is precious and betrayal is cheap. And where a violent death is the reward for being outplayed by your enemy. Will Cochrane, the Service&#39;s most prized asset and deadliest weapon, has known little else since childhood. And he&#39;s never been outplayed. So far...</p><p>Matthew Dunn was trained by SIS in all aspects of intelligence collection and direct action including agent running, deep-cover deployments, small-arms, explosives, military unarmed combat, surveillance, anti-surveillance, counter-surveillance, advanced driving, infiltration and exfiltration techniques and covert communications. He used his skills extensively on operations. Although typically he worked alone, but in conducting near seventy missions, he also had significant experience of working with highly-specialised units from the SAS and SBS as well as conducting joint-operations with MI5, GCHQ and the CIA. Medals are never awarded to modern MI6 officers, but Dunn was the recipient of a very rare personal commendation from the Foreign Secretary actions that directly influenced the successful conclusion of a major international incident. He lives in England.Great talent, great imagination, and real been-there done-that authenticity make this one of the year&#39;s best thriller debuts. Highly recommended. -- LEE CHILD Dunn, a former M16 officer, fashions a hero who looks poised to give Lee Child&#39;s Jack Reacher a run for his readers ... a twisty, cleverly crafted work. KIRKUS REVIEWS (USA) A nail-biting, edge of your seat page-turner. Matthew Dunn is an explosive new talent. -- SIMON KERNICK A terrific thriller with a superb new hero. Written by a man with the credentials to back him up. Spartan oozes class. Bond and Bourne can take a back seat... -- MATT HILTON Plenty of fireworks, a suitably anguished 21st-century hero and snappy tradecraft make this an intelligent and entertaining summer read. But what really gives Spartan the edge is the author: Matthew Dunn is a highly commended former MI6 field operative ... and the first to write a thriller. This feels solid and authentic. -- Adam LeBor FINANCIAL TIMES Excellent ... I know of no other spy thriller that so successfully blends the fascinating nuances of the business of espionage and intelligence work with full-throttle suspense storytelling. -- JEFFREY DEAVER Readers will want to see more of Dunn&#39;s distinctive hero, &#34;the ultimate killer of killers.&#34; PUBLISHERS WEEKLY (US) This debut novel has the ring of verisimilitude ... no nonsense, pulse-pounding ... readers will want to spend more time in the company of Matthew Dunn&#39;s tough agent Will Cochrane CRIMETIME I made the mistake of starting Dunn&#39;s novel at 10 o&#39;clock last evening. In no time flat my mind was trapped by the turns of this intense thriller ... this is one of the most startling thriller debuts I&#39;ve encountered. THE RAP SHEET A thriller with fast action, a great villain, several twists and turns, and enough ambiguity to escape the many obvious pitfalls of genre cliche ... the book pushes forward relentlessly. IRRISTIBLE TARGETS As a thriller, Spartan has pace and style ... Like le Carre and Fleming before him Dunn is the real thing, a former member of SIS turned fictional chronicler of the secret world. His though, is a more muscular creation than Smiley, or even Bond. Meet Will Cochrane, a one man weapon of mass destruction; 007 is a cocktail-sipping lush compared with Cochrane. DAILY TELEGRAPH</p><h2>Marriage of Inconvenience</h2><p><b>What really happened in the most scandalous love triangle of the 19th century?</b>&nbsp;The accepted story of the Ruskin marriage has never lost its fascination. History books, novels, television series, operas,&nbsp;and film have all follow&nbsp;a standard line. Effie Gray was an innocent victim of a male-dominated society, repressed and mistreated; John Ruskin, the greatest art critic and social reformer of his time, was a callous misogynist and upholder of the patriarchy; and&nbsp;John Everett Millais, boy genius, rescued the heroine from the tyrannical clutches of the husband who supposedly&nbsp;left his wedding unconsummated for six years. This narrative seems to offer an easy take on the Victorians and how we have moved on. But the story isn't true. The story turns out not to be&nbsp;all about impotence and pubic hair, but&nbsp;as much about money, power, and freedom. This book uses extensive documentary evidence&#x2014;much of it never seen before, and much of it hitherto suppressed&#x2014;to reveal a story no less fascinating and human, no less illuminating about the Victorians, and far more instructive about our own times, than the myths that have grown up about the most notorious marriage of the 19th century.</p><p><b>Robert Brownell</b> is a freelance writer and lecturer specializing in Victorian art and aesthetics,<br>particularly Ruskin and Morris."Robert Brownell weighed in with an enjoyably obsessive re-examination of the marriage of Effie and John Ruskin and the pubic hair question."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Observer</i>&nbsp;Books of the Year<br><br>"Painstakingly researched and forensically detailed portrait of a doomed marriage.

Although the defeated South may have accepted the idea of a Union preserved, it was not going to accept any more than that. This work describes the effort by white Southerners to reestablish their political and legal control amid what they perceived to be an occupying colonial power, the North. Their methods involved terror, not unlike that which Al Qaeda carries out in Iraq. Phil Gigante performs this work with energy and passion, for this is a work that stirs the emotions. He performs accents--Northern, Southern, and African-American--with equal skill. The narrative is clear and just as engaging. M.T.F. � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>King of the Mound: My Summer with Satchel Paige</h2><p><b>Baseball legend Satchel Paige changes a boy&#x2019;s life in this coming-of-age tale from the author of <i>Lucky</i>.</b><br><br>Nick was going to be a star baseball player, no doubt about it. People for miles around talked about the twelve-year-old boy with the golden arm. And then Nick is diagnosed with polio&#x2014;a life-threatening disease in the 1930s. Everyone is devastated, especially Nick&#x2019;s father, who copes by closing off from his son. When Nick finally leaves the hospital he wants nothing more than to get back in the game, but he seems to be the only one who thinks it&#x2019;s possible. But after he begins working for Mr. Churchill, the owner of a minor league team, Nick meets Satchel Paige, arguably the best player in baseball. Satchel faces obstacles of his own&#x2014;his skin color prevents him from joining the major leagues&#x2014;and he encourages Nick to overcome the odds and step out of the dugout.</p><p><b>C. W. Tooke</b> has worked as a feature writer and editorial consultant and has published features in Salon, New Jersey Monthly, and the Princeton Alumni Weekly. His first novel,<i> Lucky</i> was a Junior Library Guild Selection. He lives in San Francisco with his wife and dog.Nick stared at the strike zone and took a deep breath. That was something his dad had taught him; he said it relaxed your shoulders and cleared your head. As soon as Nick&#x2019;s lungs were empty, he began his windup, the movements as smooth and natural as the breath he had just taken, until&#x2014;<br> <br><i>SMACK!</i> The rubber ball nailed the center of the chalk square on the wall, skipped neatly on the polished linoleum, and landed next to Nick in the hospital bed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Twenty-nine,&#x201d; Nick said to himself.<br> <br>He picked up the ball, focused on the chalk target again, and took another breath. But before he could begin his windup, Dr. Miller appeared in the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you wearing out my wall again?&#x201d; Dr. Miller asked. He kept a straight face, but Nick knew he was joking&#x2014;Dr. Miller was the only adult in the whole hospital who wasn&#x2019;t afraid to laugh.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying to break my record before I leave,&#x201d; Nick said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your record?&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick pointed at the chalk square. &#x201c;Inside the strike zone eighty-seven times in a row.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dr. Miller raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Eighty-seven is a whole lot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;But not as many as eighty-eight.&#x201d;<br> <br>This time Dr. Miller did smile. &#x201c;You keep that attitude and you&#x2019;re going to be fine. Are you ready to go?&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick felt his heart speed up&#x2014;the same nervous feeling he used to get when there was a man on third base and nobody out. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Waiting downstairs.&#x201d; Dr. Miller glanced at Nick&#x2019;s duffel bag, which was lying next to the door. &#x201c;You tighten up your brace and I&#x2019;ll get the bag.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take the bag,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;He won&#x2019;t like it if I&#x2019;m not carrying my own bag.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick could tell that Dr. Miller was staring at him, but he kept his eyes locked on the metal bar at the foot of his bed. He hated the look that doctors and nurses would sometimes get&#x2014;like they felt sorry for you but didn&#x2019;t know what to say. Nick didn&#x2019;t want pity. Maybe his left leg didn&#x2019;t work the way it was supposed to, but most of the kids who came through the ward had worse problems. Polio was a terrifying disease. In mild cases you would get symptoms similar to the flu, but if you were sick enough to get transferred to this hospital, it meant you had nerve damage, which often meant paralysis. Some of the kids on the ward couldn&#x2019;t walk at all&#x2014;or even sit up in bed. And the very sickest ones couldn&#x2019;t breathe for themselves and had to be stuck in a terrifying machine called an iron lung.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Dr. Miller said after a long pause. &#x201c;But let&#x2019;s get you in that brace.&#x201d;<br> <br>The brace was made of iron with two creaky hinges and thick leather straps. It stretched from the top of Nick&#x2019;s thigh to just above his ankle, and when he wore it for more than a few hours, it would chafe and leave big red swaths on his skin. But at least he could limp around with the brace, which was certainly better than being a prisoner to a wheelchair.<br> <br>It took a few minutes to fasten the buckles, and when they were finally done, Nick slung the bag over his shoulder and limped down the hall, Dr. Miller next to him.<br> <br>&#x201c;You must be excited to see your friends,&#x201d; Dr. Miller said as they entered the elevator.<br> <br>Nick shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a year. They probably forgot about me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I doubt that. You&#x2019;re a pretty memorable kid.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick ignored the comment because he had other stuff on his mind. Over the past year Nick had imagined this moment a thousand times, but it still felt weird to be leaving the ward. On some level Nick had never really believed that his father would actually come&#x2014;the only time he&#x2019;d visited the hospital was for an hour at Christmas&#x2014;so Nick hadn&#x2019;t even bothered to say good-bye to the other kids. But Nick knew they&#x2019;d understand. People came and went on the polio ward, which was why nobody ever got too attached.<br> <br>When the elevator doors finally opened, Nick immediately saw the familiar face across the stark lobby. His father always looked out of place anywhere but behind home plate. He was stocky and bowlegged, with deep lines around his dark eyes from spending years squinting in the sun. Their landlord in Bismarck used to joke that the stork must have gotten lost the day he delivered Nick because he and his father were like opposites&#x2014;Nick was tall and thin for his age, with sandy blond hair and blue eyes. Supposedly he looked like his mother, but his father didn&#x2019;t have any old pictures so Nick didn&#x2019;t know for sure.<br> <br>His father noticed them emerge from the elevator, and he trudged across the lobby, his worn felt hat in his calloused hand. He gave Nick a long look and then turned to Dr. Miller.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that brace permanent?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>Dr. Miller ignored the question and stuck out his hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Dr. Miller,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a fine son.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick&#x2019;s father reddened as they shook hands. &#x201c;Thanks, doc. And I surely appreciate you looking after him. It&#x2019;s just . . .&#x201d; His voice trailed off, his eyes locked on the brace, and Nick suddenly wished he were wearing pants instead of shorts.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nick&#x2019;s doing great,&#x201d; Dr. Miller said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;d be wary of giving you a specific prognosis.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can he pitch? Can he play ball?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Once again, I don&#x2019;t want to make any predictions. But I think a more realistic goal is for Nick to be able to walk without a brace.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So he&#x2019;s a cripple.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dr. Miller pursed his lips. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not a word we like to use around here.&#x201d;<br> <br>They were quiet for a long moment. Nick stared at his feet, trying to keep the shock from his face. Had his father really just called him that word? <i>Cripple?</i> Just as he felt like he might burst, Nick felt a hand on his shoulder. It was Dr. Miller.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good luck, Nick,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll miss you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll miss you too,&#x201d; Nick said.<br> <br>As Nick followed his father into the parking lot, he realized that it wasn&#x2019;t exactly the truth and wasn&#x2019;t exactly a lie. He wouldn&#x2019;t miss the sharp, antiseptic smell of the ward or the chatter of the nurses early in the morning or that horrible, lonely feeling you got just before you fell asleep. But nobody in the hospital had ever called him a <i>cripple</i>. Why would his father say something like that? Unlike most of the kids in the ward, Nick could wash himself and eat normally and even walk. And, yeah, maybe he had to wear a brace, but did that mean he was permanently broken? Was that really what people outside the hospital would think about him?<br> <br>His father stopped in front of a strange-looking brown Chrysler and waited impatiently for Nick to catch up. The car was long with an enormous hood and hardly any straight lines.<br> <br>&#x201c;You got a car?&#x201d; Nick asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Churchill lent it to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice,&#x201d; Nick said, trying to be polite.<br> <br>His father rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Are you crazy? That newfangled body looks like a squashed cow patty. And those idiots in Detroit built it so badly that the engine falls out whenever it hits eighty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I like the color,&#x201d; Nick said.<br> <br>His father grunted, grabbed the bag from Nick&#x2019;s shoulder, and tossed it in the backseat. He started around the car and then paused and glanced at Nick.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you get in by yourself or do I have to help you?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can do it,&#x201d; Nick said.<br> <br>It was a long drive back to Bismarck&#x2014;almost five hundred miles. They headed north to Minneapolis, northwest to Fargo, and then due west across the rolling plain. The journey was brutal in the winter when the arctic wind was whipping snow across the road, but now, in early June, they cruised along with the windows cracked to let the sweet summer breeze into the car.<br> <br>As they drove, Nick couldn&#x2019;t help thinking about the last time he&#x2019;d been on these roads. Polio had ambushed him. One morning in late May he woke up with a fever and a stiff neck, and the moment the doctor heard his symptoms he was whisked into quarantine at the local hospital in Bismarck. At first Nick hadn&#x2019;t been worried&#x2014;other kids in his neighborhood had gotten polio and been okay. But the second morning he felt pins and needles in his legs, and he knew he was in trouble because the doctors kept whispering in the hall outside his room. By the time they put him in a truck to drive him to the Mayo Clinic, Nick had been fading in and out of consciousness, and all he really remembered about the journey was his father&#x2019;s stone expression and the soothing feeling of the nurse dabbing his forehead with a cold washcloth.<br> <br>But this time there was no nurse and no washcloth, and Nick spent most of the long drive staring out the window at the passing plains, bored. They had to stop three times for gas and oil, and once for sandwiches, and it was almost midnight by the time the car was finally rolling down Main Street. They had barely spoken two words since they left the hospital, but as they caught a glimpse of the stadium, Nick felt that old familiar rush of excitement and couldn&#x2019;t contain himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the team this year?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Best in the Dakotas,&#x201d; his father said. &#x201c;Maybe the best semipro club in the Midwest. Just depends how many more of those colored boys Mr. Churchill signs up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who have you got?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Satch, supposedly. And Red and Barney Morris. And there&#x2019;s rumors about Double Duty Radcliffe.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick tried to keep the excitement out of his voice. &#x201c;Satch is coming back?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll believe it when I see it,&#x201d; his father said.<br> <br>Nick wanted to ask more questions, but he knew from his father&#x2019;s tone that any further attempts at conversation would be answered with silence. It seemed impossible to believe that Satchel Paige might actually return to Bismarck. Of course, Nick never would have guessed that one of the greatest living pitchers would come to Bismarck in the first place, but that was only because Satch was black and the majors wouldn&#x2019;t let black players in the league.<br> <br>And so two years earlier&#x2014;the fall of 1933&#x2014;Mr. Churchill, the team&#x2019;s owner, had convinced Satch to pitch the last month of the season for Bismarck. He was nothing short of amazing as he won six of his seven starts and averaged almost fifteen strikeouts a game. Nick&#x2019;s father had caught four of those games, and Nick, who was ten at the time, had sat in the first row of the stands and watched as Satch&#x2019;s magical arm bewildered helpless batters. Satch had promised to return the following season, and the team had even rebuilt the stadium to handle the expected crowd. In fact, that had been one of the things that Nick dreaded most when he went into the hospital&#x2014;the idea that Satch might be pitching in Bismarck while he was trapped in a ward five hundred miles away had been too painful to contemplate.<br> <br>But Satch never showed up, not even after Mr. Churchill threatened to have policemen drag him back to Bismarck to fulfill his contract. Nick had followed the story in the papers&#x2014;the rumor had been that another team was paying Satch more money&#x2014;and in the wake of that nasty fight, Nick had assumed that North Dakota had seen the last of the great Satchel Paige. He was <i>very</i> glad to be wrong.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; his father said, interrupting Nick&#x2019;s thoughts.<br> <br>The car had pulled up outside a dilapidated house on the outskirts of town. Nick stared at the peeling paint and weathered door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why did you move out of Mr. Powell&#x2019;s place?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Rent went up,&#x201d; his father said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick grabbed his duffel from the backseat and then followed his father down a gravel path that led to a little cabin behind the main house. The moon was bright, but Nick still stumbled as he climbed up the stairs to the sagging porch. His father caught him by the shoulder and then roughly grabbed the bag.<br> <br>&#x201c;Quiet,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If you wake Mrs. Landry, I&#x2019;m going to hear about it in the morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>As they entered the cabin, his father flipped a switch next to the door and a naked bulb flickered to life. The inside was just one tiny room with a bed, a sink, a chair, and a small cot. Nick&#x2019;s father tossed the duffel in the corner and then began stripping off his clothes while Nick settled on the cot and struggled to undo the leather straps on his brace.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re working for Mr. Churchill this summer,&#x201d; Nick&#x2019;s father said when he was wearing just a T-shirt and his oil-stained pants. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been real nice paying for the hospital and letting me borrow the car and everything, so you&#x2019;re going to give him a hand. That&#x2019;s the deal.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;At the dealership or with the team?&#x201d; Nick asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever he wants.&#x201d; Nick&#x2019;s father glanced at his brace again. &#x201c;Whatever you can actually do. Understand?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>His father flipped off the light and then grunted as he settled into bed. Nick kept fumbling with the straps of his brace in the dark&#x2014;he would never be able to fall asleep with that thing clamped to his leg.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good night, Dad,&#x201d; he said after a minute.<br> <br>Silence. Nick kept working on the straps, and when the last one was finally undone, he lay down on the lumpy cot and pulled the rough wool blanket over his clothes.<br> <br>He was back.<br> <br>� 2012 Wes Tooke</p><h2>The Mystery of the Yellow Room (Detective Club Crime Classics) (The Detective Story Club)</h2><p><p>One of the defining novels of the entire crime genre, Gaston Leroux&#x2019;s <em>The Mystery of the Yellow Room</em> has inspired readers and writers including Agatha Christie and John Dickson Carr, and is now republished in hardback in the Detective Club series with a brand new introduction.</p><p>Breaking down her door in response to the sounds of a violent attack and a gunshot, Mademoiselle Stangerson&#x2019;s rescuers are appalled to find her dying on the floor, clubbed down by a large mutton bone.

She lives in North Canton, Ohio.Grade 4-7. Willis combines the suspense of a page-turner, the danger level of a thriller, the fascination of a survival story, and the ease of a hi/lo vocabulary. In 1793, three siblings (Amos, 13; Clara, 12; Jonathan, 7) are separated from their father during their immigration, via flatboat, down the Ohio River from their Pennsylvania home to a new beginning in the Ohio wilderness. After an Indian attack, the three are left with no adult support, scant supplies, no transportation, and a cow in tow to journey along the dangerous Shawnee side of the Ohio to the safety of the Marietta settlement. Readers will recognize the breathless pace they've loved in action movies, defined by the eruption of a new crisis on the heels of each crisis resolution, as the siblings struggle against the odds: scavenging food; stealing fire from the Indians; whittling tools for catching supper; rescuing a young Shawnee from drowning; and treating wounds with chickweed and birch leaves. The author's sturdy plot advances distinctly and chronologically, resulting in pure suspense. She keeps her vocabulary action-oriented and her dialogue straightforward. The young Shawnee's presence raises intriguing philosophical questions regarding the nature of communication and the components of true friendship.

Paris is an extraordinary, lyrical love letter to the city, taking the reader on an imaginative journey around its secret stairways, courtyards, alleys and hidden places. Whether evoking the cool of a deserted church on a hot summer&#39;s day, remembering Notre Dame in a winter storm in 1940, describing chestnut trees lit up at night like &#39;Japanese lanterns&#39; or lamenting the passing of street cries and old buildings, his book is filled with unforgettable imagery. It is a meditation on getting lost and wasting time, and on what it truly means to know a city.</p><p>Julian Green was born in Paris in 1900 and spent most of his extraordinary literary career there, writing in French for a wide European readership. He published over sixty-five books in France, including novels, essays, plays and fourteen volumes of his journal. In addition, he published five celebrated books in the United States. During the First World War, Green served in the American Red Cross and then in the French Army; during the Second World War, he worked at the US Office of War Information, broadcasting to France on the radio.

Wolsey&#39;s pan-European vision ensured that he was well aware of the threat posed by Martin Luther&#39;s theological revolution and campaign against clerical abuses. He therefore sought to nip English heresy in the bud by taking decisive action against known religious radicals and by founding Cardinal College (now Christ Church), Oxford, with a view to forming well-educated priests who would combat heresy and institute ecclesiastical reform from within the hierarchy. Among England&#39;s senior churchmen, only Wolsey might have executed such a strategy, but circumstances were combining to thwart his plans. Wolsey was frustrated and ultimately disgraced by the essentially domestic problem of the king&#39;s determination that Anne Boleyn should be his wife and the mother of his legitimate heir.

The daughter of a notorious pope, she was twice betrothed before the age of eleven and thrice married&#x2014;one husband was forced to declare himself impotent and thereby unfit and another was murdered by Lucrezia&#x2019;s own brother, Cesar Borgia. She is cast in the role of murderess, temptress, incestuous lover, loose woman, femme fatale par excellence.<br>&nbsp;<br>But there are two sides to every story.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lucrezia Borgia is the only woman in history to have serve as the head of the Catholic Church. She successfully administered several of Renaissance Italy&#x2019;s most thriving cities, founded one of the world&#x2019;s first credit unions, and was a generous patron of the arts. She was mother to a prince and to a cardinal. She was a devoted wife to the Prince of Ferrara, and the lover of the poet Pietro Bembo. She was a child of the renaissance and, in many ways, the world&#x2019;s first modern woman. <br>In this richly imagined novel, Nobel laureate Dario Fo reveals Lucrezia&#x2019;s humanity, her passion for life, her compassion for others, and her skill at navigating around her family&#x2019;s evildoings. The Borgias are unrivalled for the range and magnitude of their political machinations and opportunism. Fo&#x2019;s brilliance rests in his rendering their story as a shocking mirror image of the uses and abuses of power in our own time. Lucrezia herself becomes a model for how to survive and rise above those abuses. Part <i>Wolf Hall</i>, part <i>House of Cards</i>, <i>The Pope's Daugther</i> will appeal to readers of historical fiction and of contemporary fiction alike and will delight anyone fascinated by Renaissance Italy.</p><p>Born near Laggo Maggiore in Italy in 1926, <b>Dario Fo</b>&nbsp;is an actor, playwright, comedian, director, songwriter and political campaigner.

Stories of seedy slave speculators and corrupt traders are placed alongside detailed accounts of the economic, political and cultural impact of a system representing the most immense, concentrated human suffering in our nation&#x2019;s history.</p><p>Jack Trammell was born in Berea, Kentucky, and is descended from generations of Appalachian farmers who migrated from Normandy through England and Virginia. He is a professor, researcher and writer, as well as a small family farmer currently residing in central Virginia with his wife and seven children (Daniel, Alec, Bethany, Maddie, Mary, Chris and Hannah, and of course, Audrie!). He has more than twenty-one books to his credit, ranging from textbooks for students in gifted programs (math and history) to award-winning Appalachian writing (Jesse Stuart poetry award, etc.). His published credits include research articles in education and sociology journals (related to disability studies), as well as hundreds of articles, short stories and poems. For almost seven years, he wrote a regular military history column for the Washington Times. His education includes a BA in political science at Grove City College, a master&#x2019;s degree in history education at Virginia Commonwealth University, a special education certificate from the University of Virginia and a PhD again from VCU. Most recently, he was a visiting scholar at the DuPont-funded Summer Seminar at the National Center for the Humanities.</p><h2>Single Issues: Essays on the Crucial Social Questions</h2><p>These essays were originally published in the National Review: Crucial Issue Politics, The Abortion Sect, Nothing to Look At - Perversity and Public Amusements, Bogus Sex - Reflections on Homosexual Claims, On Fatherhood, The Established Irreligion, On Imposing One&#39;s Views, In Loco Parentis, Razing the Past, Sex Education, The Abortion Culture, The Value Free Society, Life and Death in Tendency Land, Secular Humanism or The American Way, and Happy at Home.</p><p></p><h2>The New Kosher Cookbook Trilogy</h2><p>French/Chinese/Italian -- Kosher recipes authenticated by Rabbi Norman Segal -- You don&#39;t have to be kosher to enjoy the international flavor of the 200 outstanding recipes presented in this book.</p><p></p><h2>Chasing Degas</h2><p>Monsieur Degas likes to paint the students while they practice in ballet class&#x2015;they&#x2019;ve inspired many of his beautiful paintings.

And although acquiring them in the West has become increasingly popular in recent times, most people perceive this hobby as limited to wealthy collectors. This need not be so: appreciating and collecting scholar&#39;s stones is popular among people of all means and occupations in China, and should be in the West as well. The continuing popularity of these wonderful objects has in fact meant that many more exciting stone types have become available, and at much more modest prices. All the would-be collector needs is a good eye and the basic information about stone types and characteristics that this book provides. Through descriptions and color photographs, Modern Chinese Scholars&#39; Rocks introduces over 40 stone types, including their mineral compositions, typical colors, hardness on the Mohr scale, and where they are found or quarried. The qualities for which they are valued are explained as are other features for the stone connoisseur to look for. Separate chapters explain how to display stones to their best advantage and how to make display stands. This modest, straightforward, and informative volume will engage readers in the exciting world of appreciating and collecting these natural art objects.</p><p>Kemin Hu&#x2019;s passionate interest in scholar&#x2019;s stones came from her father, Hu Zhao-kang, a noted connoisseur of Chinese antiquities. Kemin&#x2019;s own vast collection of scholar&#x2019;s rocks has been featured in several exhibitions, including at the Staten Island Botanical Garden, and she has been interviewed on Chinese television about her collecting career. She has lectured widely on the subject and is the author of Spirit of Gongshi: Chinese Scholars&#x2019; Rocks and Scholars Rocks in Ancient China: The Suyuan Stone Catalogue.</p><h2>1791: Mozart&#39;s Last Year</h2><p>The last month of the year 1791 witnessed what H.C. Robbins Landon calls &#34;the greatest tragedy in the history of music&#34;: the premature death of the thirty-five-year-old Mozart. Surrounded by enigma and intrigue, allegations of poisoning, and sexual scandal, this event continues to grip the popular imagination today--as was demonstrated by the astonishing success of the play and movie Amadeus. Curious and controversial as the circumstances of Mozart&#39;s death are, the truth has been obscured by accumulated layers of mythology. Drawing on his unrivaled knowledge of the sources, Professor Landon cuts through fantasy and mystification to present the facts--including a substantial amount of unpublished information--and reconstruct the moving story of the last year of Mozart&#39;s life. The composition of such works as the Requiem and the operas The Magic Flute and La clemenza di Tito is discussed in detail, and new light is thrown on Mozart&#39;s relations with the Freemasons and with Salieri, among others. One of the world&#39;s leading musicologists, H.C. Robbins Landon is justly renowned for his rare ability to communicate the excitement of discovery. This is a major contribution to the literature of Mozart.</p><p>When Haydn left on a concert tour to London in December 1790, Mozart said farewell forever, and most people assumed it was Haydn's health that he was worried about. As we know now, the elder composer was to live for almost two decades more; Mozart, a single year. It was to be a year in which he wrote <i>The Magic Flute</i>, <i>La Clemenza di Tito</i>, and the Clarinet Concerto, as well as most of the Requiem; it was also a year of mounting disappointment in his career as part of the Viennese musical establishment, and a year of growing debt. Robbins Landon is keen to debunk the myths: Mozart was not poisoned ,but died of progressive kidney failure, and Salieri was innocent of his death, though not of promoting his own career at Mozart's expense. Landon defends Mozart's wife, Constanze, against the libels of biographers, though at times his portrait of comfortable bourgeois monogamy sounds like special pleading and overlaps with hints of conscientious bohemian racketiness. This is a wonderful portrait of a great artist and the city where he lived; in passing, Landon tells us everything we need to know about musical life, Masonry, and the truth about that pauper's grave. <i>--Roz Kaveney</i>" Amadeus , the play and film, popularized the many legends about Mozart's 'decline and fall.' In this factual account of the composer's last year, musicologist Landon gathers authentic contemporary documents to 'bring us nearer to Mozart and his wife, Constanze, than does fiction, even at its most inspired,' " reported PW.

Let&#39;s suppose the modern era begins in October of 1922. A little French avant-garde journal publishes a photograph of a sheet of glass covered in dust. The photographer is Man Ray, the glass is by Marcel Duchamp. At first they called it a view from an aeroplane. Then they called it Dust Breeding. It&#39;s abstract, it&#39;s realist. It&#39;s an artwork, it&#39;s a document. It&#39;s revolting and compelling. Cameras must be kept away from dust but they find it highly photogenic. At the same time, a little English journal publishes TS Eliot&#39;s poem The Waste Land. &#34;I will show you fear in a handful of dust.&#34; And what if dust is really the key to the intervening years? Why do we dislike it? Is it cosmic? We are stardust, after all. Is it domestic? Inevitable and unruly, dust is the enemy of the modern order, its repressed other, its nemesis. But it has a story to tell from the other side. Campany&#39;s connections range far and wide, from aerial reconnaissance and the American dustbowl to Mussolini&#39;s final car journey and the wars in Iraq. a Handful of Dust will accompany Campany&#39;s exhibition of the same name, curated for Le Bal, Paris (16 October 2015 - 17 January 2016), with works by Man Ray, John Divola, Sophie Ristelhueber, Mona Kuhn, Gerhard Richter, Xavier Ribas, Nick Waplington, Jeff Wall and many others, alongside anonymous press photos, postcards, magazine spreads and movies.</p><p></p><h2>Towards the End of the Morning</h2><p>This tale is set in the crossword and nature-notes department of an obscure national newspaper during the declining years of Fleet Street.</p><p>Michael Frayn was born in London in 1933 and began his career as a journalist on the <i>Guardian</i> and the <i>Observer</i>.

One of these is Jason Dunham, a twenty-two-year-old Marine corporal from the one-stoplight town of Scio, New York, whose stunning story reporter Michael M. Phillips discovered while he was embedded with a Marine infantry battalion in the Iraqi desert. Corporal Dunham was on patrol near the Syrian border, on April 14, 2004, when a black-clad Iraqi leaped out of a car and grabbed him around his neck. Fighting hand-to-hand in the dirt, Dunham saw his attacker drop a grenade and made the instantaneous decision to place his own helmet over the explosive in the hope of containing the blast and protecting his men. When the smoke cleared, Dunham&#x2019;s helmet was in shreds, and the corporal lay face down in his own blood. The Marines beside him were seriously wounded. Dunham was subsequently nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor, the nation&#x2019;s highest award for military valor.<br><br>Phillips&#x2019;s minute-by-minute chronicle of the chaotic fighting that raged throughout the area and culminated in Dunham&#x2019;s injury provides a grunt&#x2019;s-eye view of war as it&#x2019;s being fought today&#x2014;fear, confusion, bravery, and suffering set against a brotherhood forged in combat. His account of Dunham&#x2019;s eight-day journey home and of his parents&#x2019; heartrending reunion with their son powerfully illustrates the cold brutality of war and the fragile humanity of those who fight it. Dunham leaves an indelible mark upon all who know his story, from the doctors and nurses who treat him, to the readers of the original<i> Wall Street Journal</i> article that told of his singular act of valor.</p><p><p>MICHAEL M. PHILLIPS, a staff reporter for the<i> Wall Street Journal</i>, has done four tours in Iraq with the Third Battalion, Seventh Marines. He lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife and two children.</p>I&nbsp; |&nbsp; <b><i>Kilo Company</i></b><br><br><b>Husaybah, Iraq</b><br>Corporal Dunham didn't play head games.<br><br>Life for the new Marines, the young guys still in shock from boot camp, was already tough enough, and Dunham didn't see the point of making them even more miserable just for kicks. But Jason's was a minority view, and it was a time-honored practice in the Marine Corps for senior enlisted men to mess with the minds of the boots, as the new guys were called. Marine commanders had in recent years tried to eliminate dangerous hazing rituals and had prohibited, among others, practices referred to in Marine Corps rules as wetting down, flopping, psychological sit-ups, pink bellies, thrashing, ordnance kisses, and Beretta bites. Commanders had also restricted the tradition of forcing Marines to do push-ups or run if they erred in small ways--calling a corporal a lance corporal, for instance, or dropping a magazine full of bullets. A senior Marine could order such punishment only if he himself did the same exercise at the same time. Nonetheless, most men in Dunham's battalion--Third Battalion, Seventh Marine Regiment, or 3/7 for short--would automatically drop and do thirty-seven push-ups if they let their rifle fall to the ground, even if nobody told them to do so. That was a matter of simple integrity, in the Marines' view. Captain Trent Gibson, Kilo Company's commander, and Lieutenant Bull Robinson, Corporal Dunham's platoon commander, did push-ups if they slipped up on the names of any of their Marines.<br><br>The crackdown on hazing and punitive exercise pretty much left senior Marines with head games--called "fuck-fuck" games--if they felt like having a little fun with the boots. The commander of Dunham's battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Matt Lopez, hadn't exactly barred fuck-fuck games. But he had warned the men that they shouldn't do anything to the junior Marines that they wouldn't do in front of the colonel himself to the colonel's own son. Nonetheless, recalling the humiliation they had put up with when they were boots, some senior enlisted Marines saw no reason to spare the next generation the same indignities. The tradition was rooted in the sharply defined military hierarchy. A Marine infantry battalion was divided into rifle companies, the companies into platoons, the platoons into squads, and the squads into fire teams. Third Battalion had 900 men and Kilo Company had 190. A fire team had just three or four. The Kilo Company officers beneath Captain Gibson were first and second lieutenants. The senior enlisted man in the company was a first sergeant, with a gunnery sergeant, staff sergeants, sergeants, corporals, lance corporals, privates first class, and privates below him in unmistakably descending order. The Marines took their hard-earned ranks seriously. They addressed each other by rank, and often men who ate, slept, and fought together didn't even know each other's first names. There was an underlying truth in the classic Marine joke: What do you do if someone tosses a hand grenade at you? Call for a private and throw him on it.<br><br>Corporal Dunham wouldn't allow fuck-fuck games in his squad. But sometimes the senior Marines got bored and toyed with the boots anyway when Dunham was out of earshot. "Put that down," a senior lance corporal barked at a junior lance corporal, Jonathon Polston, not long after Kilo Company arrived in Iraq. Polston obliged and put down the socks or helmet or CD player or whatever he was holding. As soon as he did, the senior Marine changed the order: "Pick it up. Put that down. Pick it up." Then the command shifted again: "Come here right now. Too slow--go back. Come here right now. Too slow--go back."<br><br>The game continued until Corporal Dunham saw what was going on. "Knock that shit off," he told the senior man. "If you're going to talk to him, talk to him. If not, just leave him alone."<br>* * *<br>Dunham's humane leadership won him the undying loyalty of the boots in his squad. Pfc. Kelly Miller was especially impressed when, in early March, Kilo Company's Fourth Platoon was sent to help Lima Company at its base in Husaybah. Camp Husaybah sat hard against no-man's-land, a fifty-yard-wide strip of sand, rubble, and garbage separating Syria from Iraq and claimed by both. The disputed zone was edged by tall fences and wire. Shopping bags of black, blue, and white plastic snagged on the barbs and flapped in the desert breeze like socks on a laundry line. The crossing point was a narrow road blocked on the Syrian side by a red-and-white metal gate. Anyone who bypassed the checkpoints and tried to sneak across no-man's-land risked being shot by Syrian border police on one side or Marine camp guards on the other. The war was supposed to be in Iraq, but sometimes it leaked across no-man's-land.<br><br>To the north of the Marines' outpost the border stretched through farmland toward the Euphrates River, getting wetter and greener as it approached the slow-moving waters. Iraqi boys grazed their goats on the marshy riverbanks, and during harvest season pomegranates and nectarines hung low over the American infantrymen riding on tanks or Humvees. To the south the border quickly disappeared into sandy wastelands and parched wadis, where the shrubs barely outnumbered the land mines.<br><br>Dunham's squad was assigned the task of fortifying the sprawling camp against mortars and car bombs by filling sandbags and setting up giant, cardboard-lined metal baskets called Hesco barriers. The engineers used construction machinery to fill the baskets with sand to form a thick blast wall, as much as twice a man's height, and the grunts topped them with coils of razor wire. As a squad leader, Corporal Dunham could have ducked much of the heavy labor. Instead, he worked alongside his men for a hot, hard week, and his men gratefully took notice.<br><br>Pfc. Kelly Miller, who turned twenty-one a month after arriving in Iraq, grew up in Eureka, California, an economically struggling area amid redwood-covered hills. Kelly's father, Charlie, was a retired mail carrier who had settled quietly into a routine of babysitting for his grandchildren. Kelly's mother, Linda, was a confident, energetic woman who managed a doctor's office. They lived with their three children in a working-class neighborhood in a blue, three-bedroom, one-bath house the Millers bought for $16,000 in 1971.<br><br>When Kelly, the six-foot-one, 210-pound baby of the family, turned seventeen, he took a job bagging groceries at Safeway to earn some spending money, and he gradually worked his way up to weekend night-crew manager after high school. For fun, he and his friends would trap crabs off the end of the Del Norte Street pier or race their cars by Clam Beach. Often he'd just hang out with his girlfriend, who worked in construction after finishing high school.<br><br>One morning in April 2003, while U.S. forces were taking Baghdad, Kelly ended his shift at the Safeway and walked into the Marine recruiter's office at a local strip mall. He had long been curious to find out how brave he was and how he'd perform in combat. So he signed up for the infantry, the grunts. The recruiter drove him home to get his birth certificate and high school diploma. Charlie was surprised. Linda was dismayed. Two months later Kelly was in boot camp in San Diego.<br><br>Kelly was assigned to Third Battalion and shipped to its base in Twentynine Palms, California. In the 1920s, the area, in the rocky, high desert, had been a haven for World War I veterans whose lungs had been burned by mustard gas in the trenches. Now it was a vast base designed to train Marines to fight in the brutal terrain of the Middle East and Southwest Asia. Kelly quickly realized that while he may have finished boot camp, he was still a boot. He and the other junior Marines had to sweep the dirt at the base to make it look neat, and on demand they had to serenade the senior enlisted men with "You Are My Sunshine." During urban warfare training, the grunts at Twentynine Palms had to work their way through a mock city, complete with silhouettes of bad guys and innocent bystanders. One of the new guys accidentally shot a civilian silhouette. All the boots in the squad had to write essays explaining why it was bad to shoot noncombatants. Miller paid another Marine five dollars to write his essay for him.<br><br>In Iraq, Miller and the other boots were the first ones assigned to working parties around camp. They had to guard the ammunition. When the helicopters dropped off crates of water at the Marines' base in al Qa'im, the junior Marines had to pick up the hundreds of plastic bottles that scattered around the landing area after the crates inevitably broke open. Worst of all, as far as Kelly Miller was concerned, they had to take shifts burning the feces of the 350 men at Camp Husaybah. Navy engineers, the Seabees, had built the grunts plywood outhouses called burnout units. A typical burnout unit had three holes in a row. The Seabees installed seats if they could find them; otherwise the Marines just sat side by side on the slivery wood. Beneath each hole was half a fifty-five-gallon metal drum. When a barrel got too full, Miller and Polston put on leather gloves, dragged it out of the back of the outhouse, doused the slop in Humvee fuel, and lit it on fire with a book of matches or flaming piece of toilet paper. Kelly and Jonathon watched to make sure it burned thoroughly, stirring occasionally with a metal pole and trying to dodge the bitter cloud of fetid smoke. When it burned down, the Marines added more fuel and stirred some more, repeating until only ashes remained.<br>* * *<br>Dunham had spent his first years in the Corps guarding the sub base in Georgia and transferred to the infantry when the U.S. invasion force was already fighting its way to Baghdad. He stayed in California training other Marines and ultimately joined Third Battalion's Kilo Company in September 2003, after the unit returned from its first tour in Iraq. The battalion had been home just a couple of months...</p><h2>Augustus to Constantine: The Emergence of Christianity in the Roman World</h2><p>Augustus to Constantine: The Emergence of Christianity in the Roman World</p><p></p><h2>The C.S.I.

After seven years in a convent, which she left, dismayed by its restrictions, an experience recounted in &#39;Through the Narrow Gate&#39;, Karen Armstrong struggled to establish herself in a new way of life, and became entrapped in a downward spiral, haunted by despair, anorexia and suicidal feelings. Despite her departure from the convent she remained within the Catholic Church until the God she believed in &#39;died on me&#39;, and she entered a &#39;wild and Godless period of crazy parties and numerous lovers&#39;. Her attempts to reach happiness and carve out a career failed repeatedly, in spectacular fashion. She began writing her bestseller &#39;A History of God&#39; in a spirit of scepticism, but through studying other religious traditions she found a very different kind of faith which drew from Christianity, Judaism and Islam and, eventually, spiritual and personal calm. In her own words, her &#39;story is a graphic illustration -- almost an allegory -- of a widespread dilemma. It is emblematic of a more general flight from institutional religion and a groping towards a form of faith that has not yet been fully articulated but which is nevertheless in the process of declaring itself&#39;. Her lifelong inability to pray and to conform to traditional structures of worship is shared by the many who are leaving the established churches but who desire intensely a spiritual aspect to their lives. &#39;The Spiral Staircase&#39; grapples with the issue of how we can be religious in the contemporary world, and the place and possibility of belief in the 21st-century.</p><p>Karen Armstrong speaks to the troubling years following her decision to leave the life of a Roman Catholic nun and join the secular world in 1969. What makes this memoir especially fascinating is that Armstrong already wrote about this era once---only it was a disastrous book. It was too soon for her to understand how these dark, struggling years influenced her spiritual development, and she was too immature to protect herself from being be bullied by the publishing world. As a result, she agreed to portray herself only in as "positive and lively a light as possible"---a mandate that gave her permission to deny the truth of her pain and falsify her inner experience. The inspiration for this new approach comes from T. S. Eliot's <i>Ash Wednesday</i>, a series of six poems that speak to the process of spiritual recovery. Eliot metaphorically climbs a spiral staircase in these poems---turning again and again to what he does not want to see as he slowly makes progress toward the light. In revisiting her spiral climb out of her dark night of the soul, Armstrong gives readers a stunningly poignant account about the nature of spiritual growth. Upon leaving the convent, Armstrong grapples with the grief of her abandoned path and the uncertainty of her place in the world. On top of this angst, Armstrong spent years suffering from undiagnosed temporal lobe epilepsy, causing her to have frequent blackout lapses in memory and disturbing hallucinations---crippling symptoms that her psychiatrist adamantly attributed to Armstrong's denial of her femininity and sexuality. The details of this narrative may be specific to Armstrong's life, but the meanin! g she makes of her spiral ascent makes this a universally relevant story. All readers can glean inspiration from her insights into the nature of surrender and the possibilities of finding solace in the absence of hope. Armstrong shows us why spiritual wisdom is often a seasoned gift---no matter how much we strive for understanding, we can't force profound insights to occur simply because our publisher is waiting for them. With her elegant, humble and brave voice, she inspires readers to willingly turn our attention toward our false identities and vigilantly defended beliefs in order to better see the truth and vulnerability of our existence. Herein lies the staircase we can climb to enlightenment. --<i>Gail Hudson</i><b>Praise for Karen Armstrong</b><br>&#x201c;Karen Armstrong is a genius.&#x201d; --A. N.

These remedies were used chiefly in British Homeopathic practice but after some years of neglect they are gaining more favour, especially now with the issues of allergies and antibiotic damage prevalent in today&#39;s patients. Their field of action is much broader than their name suggests. The methodology of using the bowel nosodes is illustrated with nine case histories from the human world and ten from the animal, demon strating the common guidelines that are applicable to all species. The second edition contains new cases and an extra chapter offering readers an even greater insight into this fascinating area of homeopathic practices. ABOUT THE AUTHOR:- John Paterson (1890-1954) was an orthodox Physician who converted to homeopathy. He was a Microbiologist, who was married to Elizabeth Paterson, also a Microbiologist. They both worked at the Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital and at the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital. He was President of International Homeopathic Medical League in 1939. He rightly understood that bowel bacteria were scavengers of disease, and so could be of use in homeopathy. John Paterson lived at time when &#39;cross pollenation&#39; between homeopaths and allopaths was possible and both homeopaths and allopaths were industriously researching pathology and bacteriology at this time. The Title &#39;The Bowel Nosodes written/authored/edited by John Paterson&#39;, published in the year 2017. The ISBN 9789351285496 is assigned to the Hardcover version of this title.

Unlike any author before or since, James delved deeper into the hidden worlds of his characters, in order to explore the toils and delights of their inner lives. In The Portrait of a Lady, James tells the story of one of his most enchanting heroines, Isabel Archer, a young woman from New York State whose life is changed when she is visited by her aunt, Mrs. Touchett, following the death of her father (her mother having died long before). Mrs. Touchett, who is an expatriate American living in Florence, invites Isabel to accompany her back to Europe, where everyone she meets is fascinated by her beauty, her intelligence, and her vivacity. Mr. Touchett, her uncle, makes a generous provision for her in his will, but this turns out to have unexpected and undesired consequences.</p><p></p><h2>A Spy Among Friends: Kim Philby and the Great Betrayal</h2><p>Kim Philby was the most notorious British defector and Soviet mole in history. Agent, double agent, traitor and enigma, he betrayed every secret of Allied operations to the Russians in the early years of the Cold War. Philby&#39;s two closest friends in the intelligence world, Nicholas Elliott of MI6 and James Jesus Angleton, the CIA intelligence chief, thought they knew Philby better than anyone, and then discovered they had not known him at all. This is a story of intimate duplicity; of loyalty, trust and treachery, class and conscience; of an ideological battle waged by men with cut-glass accents and well-made suits in the comfortable clubs and restaurants of London and Washington; of male friendships forged, and then systematically betrayed. With access to newly released MI5 files and previously unseen family papers, and with the cooperation of former officers of MI6 and the CIA, this definitive biography unlocks what is perhaps the last great secret of the Cold War.</p><p>Ben Macintyre is a columnist and Associate Editor on The Times. He has worked as the newspaper&#39;s correspondent in New York, Paris and Washington. He is the author of nine previous books including Agent Zigzag, shortlisted for the Costa Biography Award and the Galaxy British Book Award for Biography of the Year 2008, and the no. 1 bestsellers Operation Mincemeat and Double Cross.

The date was June 15, 1939, three months before the outbreak of the deadliest conflict in history. He was twenty-two.<br><br>It happened over a glass of champagne. John Nicholas Rede Elliott's father, Sir Claude Aurelius Elliott, OBE, was headmaster of Eton (England's grandest public school), a noted mountaineer, and a central pillar of the British establishment. Sir Claude knew everybody who was anybody and nobody who wasn't somebody, and among the many important men he knew was Sir Robert Vansittart, chief diplomatic adviser to His Majesty's government, who had close links to the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), better known as MI6, the agency responsible for intelligence gathering abroad. Nicholas Elliott arranged to meet "Van" at Ascot and, over drinks, mentioned that he thought he might like to join the intelligence service.<br><br>Sir Robert Vansittart smiled and replied: "I am relieved you have asked me for something so easy."<br><br>"So that was that," Elliott wrote many years later.<br><br>The old boys' recruitment network had worked perfectly.<br><br>Nicholas Elliott was not obviously cut out to be a spy. His academic record was undistinguished. He knew little about the complexities of international politics, let alone the dextrous and dangerous game being played by MI6 in the run-up to war. Indeed, he knew nothing whatsoever about espionage, but he thought spying sounded exciting and important and exclusive. Elliott was self-confident as only a well-bred, well-heeled young Etonian, newly graduated from Cambridge University, with all the right social connections, can be. He was born to rule (though he would never have expressed that belief so indelicately), and membership in the most selective club in Britain seemed like a good place to start doing so.<br><br>The Elliotts were part of the backbone of the empire; for generations, they had furnished military officers, senior clerics, lawyers, and colonial administrators who ensured that Britain continued to rule the waves--and much of the globe in between. One of Nicholas Elliott's grandfathers had been the lieutenant governor of Bengal; the other, a senior judge. Like many powerful English families, the Elliotts were also notable for their eccentricity. Nicholas's great-uncle Edgar famously took a bet with another Indian Army officer that he could smoke his height in cheroots every day for three months, then smoked himself to death in two. Great-aunt Blanche was said to have been "crossed in love" at the age of twenty-six and thereafter took to her bed, where she remained for the next fifty years. Aunt Nancy firmly believed that Catholics were not fit to own pets since they did not believe animals had souls. The family also displayed a profound but frequently fatal fascination with mountain climbing. Nicholas's uncle, the Reverend Julius Elliott, fell off the Matterhorn in 1869, shortly after meeting Gustave Flaubert, who declared him "the epitome of the English gentleman." Eccentricity is one of those English traits that look like frailty but mask a concealed strength; individuality disguised as oddity.<br><br>Towering over Nicholas's childhood was his father, Claude, a man of immovable Victorian principles and ferocious prejudices. Claude loathed music, which gave him indigestion, despised all forms of heating as "effete," and believed that "when dealing with foreigners the best plan was to shout at them in English." Before becoming headmaster of Eton, Claude Elliott had taught history at Cambridge University, despite an ingrained distrust of academics and an aversion to intellectual conversation. The long university vacations gave him plenty of time for mountain climbing. He might have become the most celebrated climber of his generation, but for a kneecap broken by a fall in the Lake District, which prevented him from joining Mallory's Everest expedition. A dominating figure physically and psychologically, Claude was nicknamed "the Emperor" by the boys at Eton. Nicholas regarded his father with awed reverence; in return, Claude alternately ignored or teased his only child, believing, like many fathers of his time and class, that displaying affection would make his son "soft" and quite possibly homosexual. Nicholas grew up convinced that "Claude was highly embarrassed by my very existence." His mother avoided all intimate topics of conversation, according to her only son, including "God, Disease and Below the Waist."<br><br>The young Elliott was therefore brought up by a succession of nannies and then shunted off to Durnford School in Dorset, a place with a tradition of brutality extreme even by the standards of British prep schools: every morning the boys were made to plunge naked into an unheated pool for the pleasure of the headmaster, whose wife liked to read improving literature out loud in the evenings with her legs stretched out over two small boys while a third tickled the soles of her feet. There was no fresh fruit, no toilets with doors, no restraint on bullying, and no possibility of escape. Today such an institution would be illegal; in 1925 it was considered "character-forming." Elliott left his prep school with the conviction that "nothing as unpleasant could ever recur," an ingrained contempt for authority, and a hardy sense of humor.<br><br>Eton seemed like a paradise after the "sheer hell" of Durnford, and having his father as headmaster posed no particular problem for Nicholas, since Claude continued to pretend he wasn't there. Highly intelligent, cheerful, and lazy, the young Elliott did just enough work to get by: "The increased legibility of his handwriting only serves to reveal the inadequacy of his ability to spell," noted one report. He was elected to his first club, Pop, the Eton institution reserved for the most popular boys in the school. It was at Eton that Elliott discovered a talent for making friends. In later life he would look back on this as his most important skill, the foundation of his career.<br><br>Basil Fisher was Elliott's first and closest friend. A glamorous figure with an impeccable academic and sporting record, Fisher was captain of the First XI, the chairman of Pop, and son of a bona fide war hero, Basil senior having been killed by a Turkish sniper at Gaza in 1917. The two friends shared every meal, spent their holidays together, and occasionally slipped into the headmaster's house, when Claude was at dinner, to play billiards. Photographs from the time show them arm in arm, beaming happily. Perhaps there was a sexual element to their relationship, but probably not. Hitherto, Elliott had loved only his nanny, "Ducky Bit" (her real name is lost to history). He worshipped Basil Fisher.<br><br>In the autumn of 1935 the two friends went up to Cambridge. Naturally, Elliott went to Trinity, his father's old college. On his first day at the university, he visited the writer and poet Robert Gittings, an acquaintance of his father, to ask a question that had been troubling him: "How hard should I work, and at what?" Gittings was a shrewd judge of character. As Elliott remembered: "He strongly advised me to use my three years at Cambridge to enjoy myself in the interval before the next war"--advice that Elliott followed to the letter. He played cricket, punted, drove around Cambridge in a Hillman Minx, and attended and gave some very good parties. He read a lot of spy novels. On weekends he went shooting or to the races at Newmarket. Cambridge in the 1930s boiled with ideological conflict; Hitler had taken power in 1933; the Spanish civil war would erupt in the summer of 1936; extreme Right and extreme Left fought it out in university rooms and on the streets. But the fervid political atmosphere simply passed Elliott by. He was far too busy having fun. He seldom opened a book and emerged after three years with many friends and a third-class degree, a result he considered "a triumph over the examiners."<br><br>Nicholas Elliott left Cambridge with every social and educational advantage and absolutely no idea what he wanted to do. But beneath a complacent and conventional exterior and the "languid, upper-class manner" lay a more complex personality, an adventurer with a streak of subversion. Claude Elliott's Victorian rigidity had instilled in his son a deep aversion to rules. "I could never be a good soldier because I am insufficiently amenable to discipline," he reflected. When told to do something, he tended to "obey not the order which he had actually been given by a superior, but rather the order which that superior would have given if he had known what he was talking about." He was tough--the brutality of Durnford had seen to that--but also sensitive, bruised by a lonely childhood. Like many Englishmen, he concealed his shyness behind a defensive barrage of jokes. Another paternal legacy was the conviction that he was physically unattractive; Claude had once told him he was "plug ugly," and he grew up believing it. Certainly Elliott was not classically handsome, with his gangly frame, thin face, and thick-rimmed glasses, but he had poise, a barely concealed air of mischief, and a resolute cheerfulness that women were instantly drawn to. It took him many years to conclude that he "was no more or less odd to look at than a reasonable proportion of my fellow creatures." Alongside a natural conservatism he had inherited the family propensity for eccentricity. He was no snob. He could strike up a conversation with anyone from any walk of life. He did not believe in God or Marx or capitalism; he had faith in King, country, class, and club (White's Club, in his case, the gentleman's club in St James's). But above all he believed in friendship.<br><br>In the summer of 1938 Basil Fisher took a job in the City, while Elliott wondered idly what to do with himself. The old boys soon solved that. Elliott was playing in a cricket match at Eton that summer when, during the tea interval, he was approached by Sir Nevile Bland, a senior diplomat and family friend, who tactfully observed that Elliott's father was concerned by his son's "inability to get down to a solid job of work." (Sir Claude preferred to speak to his son through emissaries.) Sir Nevile explained that he had recently been appointed Britain's minister at The Hague, in the Netherlands. Would Nicholas like to accompany him as honorary attach�? Elliott said he would like that very much, despite having no idea what an honorary attach� might actually do. "There was no serious vetting procedure," Elliott later wrote. "Nevile simply told the Foreign Office that I was all right because he knew me and had been at Eton with my father."<br><br>Before leaving, Elliott underwent a code training course at the Foreign Office. His instructor was one Captain John King, a veteran cipher clerk who was also, as it happened, a Soviet spy. King had been passing Foreign Office telegrams to Moscow since 1934. Elliott's first tutor in secrecy was a double agent.<br><br>Elliott arrived at The Hague in his Hillman Minx in the middle of November 1938 and reported to the legation. After dinner, Sir Nevile offered him a warning--"in the diplomatic service it is a sackable offense to sleep with the wife of a colleague"--and some advice--"I suggest you should do as I do and not light your cigar until you have started your third glass of port." Elliott's duties were hardly onerous--a little light bag carrying for the minister, some coding and decoding in the wireless room, and attendance at formal dinners.<br><br>Elliott had been in the Netherlands only four months when he got his first taste of clandestine work and an "opportunity to see the German war machine at first hand." One evening, over dinner, he fell into conversation with a young naval officer named Glyn Hearson, the assistant naval attach� at the embassy in Berlin. Commander Hearson confided that he was on a special mission to spy on the port of Hamburg, where the Germans were believed to be developing midget submarines. After a few more glasses, Hearson asked Elliott if he would care to join him. Elliott thought this a splendid idea. Sir Nevile gave his approval.<br><br>Two days later, at three in the morning, Elliott and Hearson broke into Hamburg's port by climbing over the wall. "We discreetly poked our noses all over the place for about an hour" taking photographs, Elliott recalled, before "returning to safety and a stiff drink." Elliott had no diplomatic cover and no training, and Hearson had no authority to recruit him for the mission. Had they been caught, they might have been shot as spies; at the very least, the news that the son of the Eton headmaster had been caught snooping around a German naval dockyard in the middle of the night would have set off a diplomatic firestorm. It was, Elliott happily admitted, "a singularly foolhardy exploit." But it had been most enjoyable and highly successful. They drove on to Berlin in high spirits.<br><br>April 20, 1939, was Hitler's fiftieth birthday, a national holiday in Nazi Germany and the occasion for the largest military parade in the history of the Third Reich. Organized by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, the festivities marked a high point of the Hitler cult, a lavish display of synchronized sycophancy. A torchlight parade and cavalcade of fifty white limousines, led by the Fuhrer, was followed by a fantastic five-hour exhibition of military muscle involving fifty thousand German troops, hundreds of tanks, and 162 warplanes. The ambassadors of Britain, France, and the United States did not attend, having been withdrawn after Hitler's march on Czechoslovakia, but some twenty-three other countries sent representatives to wish Hitler a happy birthday. "The Fuhrer is feted like no other mortal has ever been," gushed Goebbels in his diary.<br><br>Elliott watched the celebrations, with a mixture of awe and horror, from a sixth-floor apartment in the Charlottenburger Chaussee belonging to General Noel Mason-MacFarlane, the British military attach� in Berlin. "Mason-Mac" was a whiskery old warhorse, a decorated veteran of the trenches and Mesopotamia. He could not hide his disgust. From the balcony of the apartment there was a clear view of Hitler on his saluting podium. The general remarked under his breath to Elliott that Hitler was well within rifle range: "I am tempted to take advantage of this," he muttered, adding that he could "pick the bastard off from here as easy as winking." Elliott "strongly urged him to take a pot shot." Mason-MacFarlane thought better of the idea, though he later made a formal request to be allowed to assassinate Hitler from his balcony. Sadly for the world, the offer was turned down.<br><br>Elliott returned to The Hague with two newly minted convictions: that Hitler must be stopped at all costs and that the best way of contributing to this end would be to become a spy. "My mind was easily made up." A day at Ascot, a glass of fizz with Sir Robert Vansittart, and a meeting with an important person in Whitehall did the rest. Elliott returned to The Hague still officially an honorary attach� but in reality, with Sir Nevile Bland's blessing, a new recruit to the Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6. Outwardly his diplomatic life continued as before; secretly he began his novitiate in the strange religion of British intelligence.<br><br>Sir Robert Vansittart, the Foreign Office mandarin who smoothed Elliott's way into MI6, ran what was, in effect, a private intelligence agency outside the official orbit of government but with close links to both MI6 and MI5, the Security Service. Vansittart was a fierce opponent of appeasement, convinced that Germany would start another war "just as soon as it feels strong enough." His networ...</p><h2>Paris 1937: Worlds on Exhibition</h2><p><p>This elegant and theoretically informed book, illustrated with forty-five photographs, explores the cultural significance of six exhibitions or new museum installations, all opening in Paris between mid-1937 and early 1938: the commercially oriented world's fair titled L'Exposition Internationale des Art et Techniques; the historical Mus�e des Monuments Fran�ais; the ethnographic Mus�e de l'Homme; two massive art retrospectives, one sponsored by the state of France and the other by the municipality of Paris; and L'Exposition Internationale du Surr�alisme.</p><p>James D. Herbert capitalizes on the proximity of these disparate exhibits to show how they competed with and yet also complemented one another in visually rendering the full scope of human accomplishment through time and across the globe. In this task, Herbert argues, they both succeeded and failed in interesting and productive ways. He asserts that the exhibitions projected and, in a sense, created (created precisely through the act of projection) the real world that they ostensibly only represented.</p><p>In fact, Herbert argues, the exhibitions developed a particular sense of French national identity&#x2015;one that, in managing to be at the same moment both inwardly focused and beneficently expansive, would present a vivid contrast to the growing German nationalism of the Third Reich. His epilogue takes a final look at these issues from the perspective of Jean Cocteau's 1950 film <i>Orph�e</i>. A ground-breaking work in cultural history, <i>Paris 1937</i>, with its insightful examination of objects from a variety of fields, is a pioneering text in the field of visual studies.</p></p><p><p>James D. Herbert is Professor and Chair, Department of Art History, University of California, Irvine. He is the author of <i>Fauve Painting: The Making of Cultural Politics</i>.</p><p>"Herbert's study is informed by astute critical analysis of texts and images associated with the diversity of Parisian exhibition during the wondrous, ominous year of 1937. His intellectual range opens the reader to one insight after another. Herbert shows himself to be as familiar with the medievalism of 1937 as with its Marxism, and, what is more, knows how to connect the two. This account of modern French culture at a critical moment is comprehensive while concise, both remarkably instructive and remarkably witty. It will be remembered."</p> (Richard Shiff, Effie Marie Cain Regents Chair in Art and Director, Center for the Study of Modernism, University of Texas)<br><br><p>"Jim Herbert has written a moving and often poetic reflection on the international exhibition of arts and industries held in Paris in 1937."</p> (Keith Moxey, author of <i>The Practice of Theory: Poststructuralism, Cultural Politics, and Art History</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>Paris 1937</i> is a cultural history focused on a particular space in Paris at the end of the 1930s in which fine art and the spectacle of culture were mobilized to do a certain kind of job. Herbert has an almost insatiable appetite for research. He is a historian who has found a way to put theory to use in a manner that is fully integrated with the text. His approach opens up avenues of engagement with new problems and issues in art and cultural history."</p> (Fred Orton, University of Leeds)</p><h2>The Quark and the Jaguar : Adventures in the Simple and the Complex</h2><p>This book is about how the wonderful diversity of the universe can arise out of a set of fairly simple basic laws.

It shone too on St Anne's Hospital, a sprawling red brick edifice cramped by the mean streets around it, although not all were mean, in some of them the early Victorian houses, tall and narrow, each with its railed off area and attic windows, had made a brave effort to overcome shabbiness and were let out in flats or rooms. Even the attics had been converted into what were grandly called studio flats with tiny kitchens and showers squeezed into corners under the rafters.<p>The windows of one such flat, half way down a terrace in a side street lined with dusty plane trees, were open wide now, allowing the sun to shine in. It shone on the woman sitting in front of a rather battered dressing table, allowing her to take excellent stock of her reflection in its mirror. It was a charming one, although its owner didn't appear to like it overmuch. She had her hand up to her hair, tugging it this way and that, peering at it intently.</p><p>'There are bound to be some,' the woman said loudly and with impatience, 'I dare say the light's all wrong.' She abandoned her search and scrutinised her face, looking for wrinkles. But there weren't any of those either; her reflection frowned back at her, a lovely face with a creamy skin to go with her fiery hair and large green eyes. 'Well, there ought to be,' said the woman, 'the first grey hairs and wrinkles show up at thirty,' she added gloomily, 'next year I'll be thirty-one...'</p><p>She left the dressing table and crossed the room to drink the rest of a mug of tea on the table at the other side. She was a tall woman with generous curves, and despite her thirty years, looked a great deal younger. She finished the tea and began to dress and presently, in her dark blue sister's uniform, sat down in front of the mirror again and did her face and brushed her thick bright hair into a chignon. She had wasted time looking for the wrinkles; and there was only time for another pot of tea and some toast before she went on duty. She made the divan bed along one wall while the kettle boiled and then sat down at the table to drink the brew and munch her toast, wasting no time. Ten minutes later, the breakfast things stacked tidily in the sink in the tiny kitchen she let herself out of her room and locked the door, then with her cape slung over one shoulder ran down the three flights of stairs to the front door. No one else was about yet in the quiet street but once at its end she turned into a wider thoroughfare, bustling with morning traffic and early morning workers. It was a shabby street, with tatty shops and run down houses, and it led straight past the hospital gates, a mere five minutes' walk. All the same the woman had cut it fine and hurried across the courtyard and in through the imposing entrance, pausing in the enormous, gloomy hall to peer into the head porter's little office.</p><p>'Morning George, any letters?' </p><p>George, it was said jokingly, was as old as the hospital. He licked the pencil he was holding and on his newspaper made a cross by the name of the horse he intended to back later on that day before he answered. 'Good morning, Sister Mitchell, nice post for you this morning, too. Got a birthday?'</p><p>'As a matter of fact, I have.' She beamed at him and took the handful of cards and letters, longing to open them at once, but they would have to wait until she had taken the night nurses' report. She made for the stairs, taking them two at a time since there was no one except George to see her.</p><p>There was though; standing at the top of the wide staircase was a very large man with wide shoulders and a distinguished air, much heightened by the elegance of his clothes. He had dark hair, greying at the temples, dark eyes with drooping lids, a formidable nose and a mouth which was firm to the point of grimness.</p><p>Sister Mitchell, not expecting anyone on the half landing, skidded to a brief halt. Her good morning was brisk and friendly; she had no time to dally, not that Professor van der Wagema ever dallied...</p><p>He glanced at the thin gold watch on his wrist. 'Late, Sister Mitchell?' His voice was bland and had a nasty edge to it. 'Don't let me keep you from completing your gallop.'</p><p>'Oh, I won't, sir,' she assured him cheerfully and raced up the right hand wing of the staircase, reflecting as she went that it was a great pity that he was such an irritable man; so good looking, at the top of his profession and possessed, so rumour had it, of far more wealth than he needed. That was all rumour had been able to discover about him though. His private life was a closed book to all but his closest colleagues at the hospital, and they weren't likely to tell. 'Why's he here, anyway?' she muttered.</p><p>'Eight o'clock in the morning...' She went through the swing doors of the Women's Medical and crossed the landing to her office.</p><p>Three girls were waiting for her, her senior staff nurse, Pat Down, a quiet sensible girl with a pleasant face, and the two night nurses, one tall and fair with a pretty face and her junior, a small mouselike girl; all three looked flushed and harassed.</p><p>Sister Mitchell sat herself down at her desk. 'Good morning. Have we had a case in during the night?' She smiled at them. 'You all look worn out and I passed Professor van der Wagema on the stairs.'</p><p>'He was sent for at half-past six, Sister, I'm to tell you that he will be back later in the morning.' The senior night nurse answered.</p><p>'Splendid, shall we have the report then?'</p><p>The night nurse looked disappointed; in common with any number of the nurses at St Anne's, she considered Professor van der Wagema the answer to any ambitious girl's prayer, he might no longer be young like their numerous men friends, but he was infinitely more handsome even if he had a bad temper and wasn't above reducing them to tears with his sarcasm during lectures. All the same, she began on the report obediently; Sister Mitchell in her own small way, could be just as unbending, besides everyone knew that she and the professor didn't like each other.</p><p>'Miss Thorpe,' began the night nurse, 'Raynaud's disease...'</p><p>There were twenty-four patients, the report took quite a few minutes before the new admission could be mentioned; Mrs Collins, admitted in a coma of unknown origin at four o'clock. Examined by the medical officer on duty and by the medical registrar. Since she didn't respond to treatment Professor van der Wagema was called, who diagnosed a suspected cerebral embolism. 'Nothing's back from the Path Lab yet.' She added nursing details and Sister Mitchell asked: 'Relatives? Anyone come in with her, Nurse?'</p><p>'No, Sister. She lives in a room in Belsize Street and works in a factory in Limehouse; she didn't go to work and someone went round to see why not. No one seemed to know anything about her, so they got a policeman to open the door and found her on the floor.'</p><p>Sister Mitchell nodded slowly. 'Poor soul, let's hope someone turns up. The police have the details?' Her generous mouth curved in a smile. 'Thanks, Nurse, off with you both then. You're both on together tonight? Who's with Mrs Collins, Pat?'</p><p>'Nurse Wells, Sister, the other three are clearing breakfast and starting on the BP round.'</p><p>'Then let's go and take a look.'</p><p>Sister didn't hurry down the ward; she never appeared to do so, but she always managed to be where she was wanted. She went calmly, wishing any of the patients that caught her eye a good morning, and slid behind the cubicle curtains. She wished Nurse Wells a pleasant good morning, asked a handful of pertinent questions and bent to look at Mrs Collins, a lady of middle years and extremely stout. She was still deeply unconscious and after a minute Sister turned away. 'Let me know if you see anything, Nurse,' she warned and went back to her office; the morning's work would go on as usual; the student nurses would have to come to the office while she read the report to them and Pat kept an eye on the ward, she would have to get on to the Path Lab and get the results of the blood sugar and blood urea tests; it was far too soon to get the lumbar puncture results. There was the post too and her morning round...</p><p>The student nurses filed in, and she spent ten minutes going over the report with them and then allotting ward duties. That done, she was free to go back into the ward, armed with the day's letters and start the routine she never varied. The patients counted on her slow progress from bed to bed, it gave them a chance to air their grievances, complain about sleepless nights, ask questions about their condition and enlist her help over knotty problems they couldn't solve from their beds. She came to the last bed; Mrs Winter, a diabetic who had never quite grasped what was wrong with her and therefore spent a good deal of time in hospital being stabilised. 'I bin awake since four o'clock, Sister,' she said, avid for news of the new patient. 'Proper poorly, isn't she? All them doctors and nurses and the professor here, without his breakfast, I dare say, poor man.'</p><p>Julia Mitchell looked surprised. She had never thought of the professor in that light and certainly she had never pitied him, although now that she came to think about it, she was sorry for him although she wasn't sure why.</p><p>She said now in a soothing voice: 'Oh, I shouldn't worry, Mrs Winter, I expect he's got a wife to look after him.' A poor down-trodden creature, probably, never saying boo to a goose let alone to the professor. 'Did you eat all your breakfast, Mrs Winter?'</p><p>'The 'am, Sister dear, but I couldn't stomach the bread...'</p><p>'Did you eat none of it, Mrs Winter?' Julia asked calmly; whichever nurse had seen to the diabetic breakfasts would have to be spoken to.</p><p>'No, ducks.'</p><p>'Then I'm going to bring you two cream crackers and you're going to eat every crumb. Will you do that?'</p><p>'Anything to please yer, love,' said Mrs Winter obligingly.</p><p>Julia went to the kitchen, found the crackers, put two on a plate and bore them to the ward. She hadn't quite reached it when she heard the swing doors...</p></p><h2>MacPelican&#39;s American Adventure (Gamebook)</h2><p>Because they take all the wrong turns and have other major problems while traveling to the Grand Louisiana Exhibition in 1898, the MacPelican clan needs the reader&#39;s help to find the way.</p><p><p>Gr 1-3--Fans of Waldo who have patience, fortitude, and great vision will be the audience for this oversized book with crowded double-page spreads.

Common folkloric elements, such as an unhappy childless queen, unheeded advice, and magical transformations, are eventually capped by the expected happily-ever-after ending. The unexpected aspect here is the active role taken by its hoydenish heroine. The elder of twins magically born to the previously barren queen, Tatterhood, dresses in rags and rides upon a goat. Yet it is she who sets out to restore her sister, Isabella, to health when vengeful hobgoblins steal her head and replace it with the head of a calf. Tatterhood successfully vanquishes the hobgoblins and the two sisters then enjoy three more years of unspecified adventures, finally meeting a handsome king and his brother. This precipitates the happy ending of a double wedding and a triumphant journey home. The text flows smoothly, retaining enough of the original language to convey the flavor of the tale, but Mills changes some details to make the story more accessible to modern readers. The appealing illustrations are slightly reminiscent of Michael Hague's work and suit the exotic charm of the unusual story well. The cover illustration is particularly attractive and, along with the feisty heroine, should ensure that the book finds an enthusiastic audience. --Lisa Dennis, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Not the English ``Tattercoats'' (a Cinderella variant) but a long tale, from Asbjornsen and Moe, about twin sisters--pretty Isabella and feisty, independent Tatterhood--born after the queen eats not only the flower she's told will bring her a baby, but also the weed growing beside it. Hobgoblins catch the queen eating the weed and demand Tatterhood on her 12th birthday as recompense; but when the time comes, the lass mounts a goat and chases the hobgoblins away with a wooden spoon. Still, they manage to enchant Isabella, so the sisters set out on a long voyage/adventure during which the hobgoblins are defeated, Isabella marries a king, and Tatterhood finds a prince who values her assertiveness and wild ways. Mills's retelling is lively with incident; her paintings, formally framed in white margins, owe a great deal to Rackham--subdued amber-drenched palette, appealingly fey characters (especially the goblins), etc.--but without Rackham's powerful drafting and design; still, they incorporate many amusing details. An attractive presentation of an entertaining, little-known tale that could be a folkloric precursor of Pippi Longstocking. (Folklore/Picture book. 5-10) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A thrill swept through me as my father proclaimed, "My little songbird has given us the correct response! Do you see why her answer is right, boys? She is equal to any one of you!"</p><p>I looked at him, delighting in the proud glow on his thin face. But, peering shyly at the boys in the classroom for approval, I saw dour expressions instead. They muttered to one another, a whisper of complaint that made me clutch my father's arm, alarmed and confused.</p><p>Perhaps I combine two early memories into one, but it seems I looked away from the aggrieved students to the long, narrow windows of the yeshiva, where several of the neighborhood wives peered in. They clucked their tongues dolefully, shaking their heads at this girl seated where she should not be, studying with boys. Their disapproval made me shrink back against my father's chest.</p><p>But as my glance moved up to my father's smiling face, I ignored the undercurrents of irritation swelling around me. My papa was pointing to those passages in the Talmud that confirmed my correct answer, flipping pages, showing me here, here, and here. Following his finger as it moved across the illuminated pages, I remember how my cheeks flushed in pride, my joy at his attention overshadowing every other emotion.</p><p>�</p><p>Like so many of my orphaned playmates, I could barely remember my mother. Pressed in among the women at prayer, there were moments when I caught a familiar scent or heard a melody in someone's chanting that brought me to the edge of memory, envisioning a hazy white face looking fondly down at me, smoothing my hair, singing a wordless tune. But I could not penetrate the fog that misted my thoughts when I tried to conjure my mother's face, the softness of her dress when I rested my cheek against her chest.</p><p>My mother had persevered despite many futile pregnancies. Trying desperately to fulfill the biblical commandment to be fruitful and multiply, she suffered time and again through prolonged childbirth, four times enduring hours of pain only to deliver dead babies. Three others died in the early days of infancy. The midwife pulled each of these keening, wizened beings forth and shook her head at the anguish in my father's questioning eyes. My own birth was considered nothing less than a miracle by my long-suffering parents, who took enormous pleasure in my fat limbs, clear, dark eyes, and healthy cry.</p><p>The last baby, the boy who took my mother's life, was the gravest of my father's many disappointments. My father was, after all, Rabbi Shmuel ben Solomon, the great Talmudic scholar of Falaise -- a man who hungered for a son. My mother was his second wife. My father's first bride died from a lingering fever mere months after the young couple wed. Engrossed in his studies, Papa let several years pass before he discharged his duty to the community and married again.</p><p>I remember huddling in a dark corner of the long, gloomy synagogue hallway at the age of four, waiting for my father. I sat with my knees pressed to my chest, my arms wrapped around them on that cold, wet, melancholy afternoon. The sound of steady rain on the rooftop made me recall a child's tale in which mourning angels wept teardrops of sadness, drenching the earth.</p><p>Unseen in my corner, I overheard the mother of one of my friends whispering to a bride newly come to our community, "That's her. That's the rabbi's daughter."</p><p>"He has only one?"</p><p>"Her mother was brought to bed just yesterday -- lost another child. Her third or fourth, I forget how many. A sad thing. But the rabbi is always so kind, where other men might complain and beat her...oh! Good evening, Rabbi."</p><p>My father emerged from the door of one of the antechambers. A small group of older students was huddled around him, but the men dispersed when the housewives approached, laughing and talking as they walked off.</p><p>"Good evening," my father said solemnly, but with the smile that always made people beam back at him -- what I used to call his white smile.</p><p>"Rabbi, Floria was just telling me about your poor wife. I hope she's well," said the new bride.</p><p>My father's smile dissolved. "Thank you, Ruth. She is weak yet. We hope for better luck next time."</p><p>"I was telling Ruth how kind you are, despite her many miscarriages. Not every man in the community would be so gentle, you know."</p><p>My father's shoulders hunched. But he laughed disparagingly, "Well, I act as my Talmud instructs. That's all."</p><p>"The men should take a lesson in patience from you," Floria said, balling her fists on her stout waist. "We women always tell them so."</p><p>My father laughed again, but I detected a bitter tinge to his mirth. Even as young as I was, I knew he yearned for a son. It was something I had always known.</p><p>Later I would learn how a boy might have continued the unbroken line of scholarship that stretched back to his ancestors, who were students and teachers in the great Babylonian schools. My grandfather Solomon had had three other sons, each of whom was blessed with boys. My father consoled himself that the family name and its revered scholarly tradition would not disappear altogether. But he felt incomplete despite his pride in the Jewish seminary he had founded -- a <i>yeshiva</i> similar to those where he had studied as a boy and a young man in France and Germany, the area of Europe we Jews called Ashkenaz. Whenever the family gathered, he watched his nephews growing into thoughtful, intelligent men and must have longed for sons of his own.</p><p>My mama died when I was nearly five and Papa had only me to care for. Perhaps that was why he indulged us both, putting me on his knee when he studied from the sacred book of the Talmud long after I should have been banished to the kitchen to learn more womanly skills.</p><p>�</p><p>Bella Tova, our good and pious neighbor, walked up the path through our kitchen garden one spring morning carrying a covered kettle of stewed beef, still bubbling and warm. She rapped on the heavy oak side door. Our family maidservant, a straw-haired Christian girl named Jeanne, came to the door to greet her. Bella Tova, wearing the highnecked gown and hair covering of the modest Jewish wife, would later recall how taken aback she was by Jeanne's unlaced bodice and the way her blond hair was tied back with just a thin ribbon, loose curls escaping around fire-flushed cheeks.</p><p>Jeanne was my wet nurse, hired by my parents to place their children to her ample breasts to suckle. Her own baby had died of a fever and Jeanne's husband, Pierre, a foot soldier under the command of a local baron, had perished fighting in the arid desert during one of the Crusades. Jeanne told me endless stories about her husband's bravery and beauty, how he was pledged to rid the Holy Land of infidels. I was too young to understand Jeanne's measuring glance as she spoke of the unbelievers living in Jesus Christ's homeland -- and for years I confused Jesus Christ, Jeanne's son of God, and the baron her beloved Pierre had served.</p><p>Had my mother lived, Jeanne's stories would have dissipated in the vapors of infant memory. But after she weaned me, Jeanne's milk dried up. She complained she had been robbed of her livelihood. Partly because her claim was just and mostly because he needed someone to care for me, Papa retained Jeanne as my nursemaid and the family's sole servant.</p><p>I adored Jeanne as the one warm constant of my life. When I scraped my knee, her cornflower eyes welled with tears. I fell asleep to the music of her lullabies. She sang of a cradle that, perched in the boughs of a tall tree, smashed into the green ground when the branch snapped. Curiously, the song always made me feel warm inside, knowing Jeanne would catch me if I fell. Jeanne taught me to sing the romantic ballads of the age, songs of great chivalry such as "La fille du roi d'espagne" and the lighthearted "Aucassin et Nicolette." As soon as I could talk, music and poetry were always on my lips, prompting my father to bestow upon me my baby name -- Songbird.</p><p>It was not unusual back then for Jewish households to hire Christian servants. From time to time, fresh laws put forth by the Pope in Rome or by our own local rulers tried to prevent too much familiarity between Jew and Gentile. We Jews were careful not to confide too greatly in the Christians we hired. We harkened to scandalous whispers of Gentiles bringing priests to back doors in the dead of night to baptize new babies. Stories circulated of servants collecting cakes of <i>matzo</i> made for our Passover feasts, offering them as evidence that we murdered Christian children to use their blood in the recipe. Less sensational but almost as terrifying was the prospect that the Gentiles in our homes might befoul our food or undo our careful observances of the Law.</p><p>What happened that day when Bella Tova visited our house would be the subject of much outraged discussion in our small community. Bella Tova watched in horror as Jeanne, thanking her for the stew, propped it on the far hob in the great stone kitchen fireplace and stirred it with the spoon already in her hand. A pot of milk warmed on the hearth. Bella Tova gasped as Jeanne removed the spoon from the meat, wiped its curved back carelessly on her apron, and put it into the milk. The Christian girl, hearing the neighbor's intake of breath, stepped back hastily. Perhaps she recalled my father's instructions to always, always keep milk and meat dishes separate. But Jeanne could be stubborn and she squared her shoulders and stood her ground.</p><p>"Jeanne, where is the rabbi?" Bella Tova's flinty tones staked a claim of duty.</p><p>Jeanne raised her chin, her eyes narrowed, and -- according to my neighbor -- her ample bosom heaved with insolence. "With his students, of course," she retorted. "I will not disturb him."</p><p>"And where would young Shira be?" Bella Tova persisted. She was glad to...</p></p><h2>Of Human Bondage</h2><p>This is a reproduction of a book published before 1923.

In spite of that, these Proustian works of recall are riveting proof of the incantatory power of words. From straightforward digressions on his aged mother and his in-laws to a complicated, slightly bizarre piece called "the structuralist" (a lengthy profile of a red-headed, muscular dwarf who's a linguist, translator, and painter), each section is sparked by Antin's recollection of being invited to "read" at a conference or a seminar. In "the fringe," he recalls the Sixties when, with John Ashbery and Ed Sanders, they were "three-penny poets reading against the war." In the title story, which provides a key to Antin's work, he objects to the artist Christo's being identified as avant-garde "because the chamber of commerce is perfectly cheerful about" his projects. Highly recommended for all collections of modern literature and art.<br><i>- Ron Antonucci, Hudson Lib. &amp; Historical Soc., Ohio</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Asked to participate in a poetry festival, Antin ( Talking at the Boundaries ) tells the caller: "i / dont read anymore i talk and that whatever i happened to say / that was my poetry." This is his third collection of transcribed oral pieces, and the method has worn thin. To be sure, he attempts to gear his autobiographical monologue to each audience. But the focus of these pieces, which average at 30 pages, quickly strays to anything and everything: his Manhattan apartment, his job translating scientific texts, the rise and cost of living. Pompous and egotistical, he ends up hurling words in the general direction of his listeners. Spread randomly on the printed page, his words unfortunately capture all the drone of performance: prosaic, unpunctuated, refusing capitalization. One assumes, from Antin's prefatory remarks to each poem, that this book collects only his most successful monologues. Frankly, it's hard to tell. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>In the Presence of His Majesty</h2><p>n the Presence of His Majesty features excerpts from previously unpublished works by best-selling devotional writer Oswald Chambers.

Morpurgo is jocular and colloquial as he adds descriptive details and conversation in retelling 21 tales of the venerable Aesop. Accompanied by humorous watercolor scenes in varied sizes, some tales extend for several pages, while others are complete on two. The concluding lessons, set in larger type, tend to lack the pithiness of those in many older collections, though some are more economical than others. "Obstinacy may look like strength. It rarely is." The reteller seems undecided as to how deadly the fate of some characters should be&#x2013;or at least how specifically it should be stated. In "The Rat and the Elephant," not usually found in Aesop, he says of the cat's pursuit of the rat, "Well, I won't tell you what happened. You'll just have to imagine it." However, he adds a bit of ill fate for the boy who cried "wolf." Unlike most versions, the boy, along with his sheep, is eaten. Morpurgo includes no notes on his sources or choices of tales and alterations. These cheerful, well-crafted offerings will work well for independent reading and reading aloud.&#x2013; <i>Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He served in the Second World War from 1940 until 1945, and began writing for his living in 1949 after spending two years in the Arctic. Since 1949 he has lived in or visited almost every part of Canada and many other lands, including the distant regions of Siberia. He is the bestselling author of forty-seven books, which have been published in more than twenty languages in more than sixty countries.The Coming of Mutt<br><br>An oppressive darkness shadowed the city of Saskatoon on an August day in 1929. By the clock it was hardly noon. By the sun--but the earth had obliterated the sun. Rising in the new deserts of the southwest, and lifting high on autumnal winds, the desecrated soil of the prairies drifted northward; and the sky grew dark.<br><br>In our small house on the outskirts of the city my mother switched on the electric lights and continued with the task of preparing luncheon for my father and for me. Father had not yet returned from his office, nor I from school. Mother was alone with the somber day.<br><br>The sound of the doorbell brought her unwillingly from the kitchen into the hall. She opened the front door no more than a few inches, as if expecting the menace of the sky to thrust its way past her into the house.<br><br>There was no menace in the appearance of the visitor who waited apologetically on the step. A small boy, perhaps ten years of age, stood shuffling his feet in the gray grit that had been falling soundlessly across the city for a day and a night. He held a wicker basket before him and, as the door opened, he swung the basket forward and spoke in a voice that was husky with the dust and with the expectation of rebuff.<br><br>"Missus," he asked in a pale, high tone, "would you want to buy a duck?"<br><br>Mother was a bit nonplussed by this odd echo of a catch phrase that had already withered and staled in the mouths of the comedians of the era. Nevertheless, she looked into the basket and to her astonishment beheld three emaciated ducklings, their bills gaping in the heat, and, wedged between them, a nondescript and bedraggled pup.<br><br>She was touched, and curious--although she certainly did not want to buy a duck.<br><br>"I don't think so," she said kindly. "Why are you selling them?"<br><br>The boy took courage and returned her smile.<br><br>"I gotta," he said. "The slough out to the farm is dry. We ate the big ducks, but these was too small to eat. I sold some down to the Chinee Grill. You want the rest, lady? They're cheap--only a dime each."<br><br>"I'm sorry," Mother replied. "I've no place to keep a duck. But where did you get the little dog?"<br><br>The boy shrugged his shoulders. "Oh, him," he said without much interest. "He was kind of an accident, you might say. I guess somebody dumped him out of a car right by our gate. I brung him with me in case. But dogs is hard to sell." He brightened up a little as an idea struck him. "Say, lady, you want him? I'll sell him for a nickel--that way you'll save a nickel for yourself."<br><br>Mother hesitated. Then almost involuntarily her hand went to the basket. The pup was thirsty beyond thirst, and those outstretched fingers must have seemed to him as fountains straight from heaven. He clambered hastily over the ducks and grabbed.<br><br>The boy was quick to sense his advantage and to press it home.<br><br>"He likes you, lady, see? He's yours for just four cents!"<br><br>Less than a month had elapsed since my parents and I had come out of the verdant depths of southern Ontario into the arid and dust-shrouded prairies.<br><br>It had seemed a foolhardy venture then, for those were the beginnings of the hard times, even in the east; while in the west the hard times--the times of drought and failure--were already old. I do not know what possessed my father to make him exchange the security of his job in Windsor for a most uncertain future as Saskatoon's librarian. It may be that the name itself, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, attracted him irresistibly. It may have been simply that he was tired of the physical and mental confines of a province grown staid and stolid in its years.<br><br>In any case he made his decision in the fall of 1928, and the rest of us acquiesced in it; I, with a high heart and bright anticipation; Mother, with grave reservations and gloomy prophecies.<br><br>Father spent that winter building a caravan, a trailer-house which was destined to carry us westward. It was a long winter for me. On Saturdays I joined my father under a shed and here we hammered and sawed industriously, and the caravan took shape. It was an unconventional shape, for my father was a sailor at heart and he had had but little experience in the design of land conveyances. Our caravan was, in reality, a houseboat perched precariously on the four thin wheels of an old Model T chassis. Her aspect was bluff and uncompromising. Her sides towered straight from the frame a full seven feet to a gently cambered deck (which was never referred to as a roof). She was big-boned and buxom, and she dwarfed poor Eardlie--our Model A Ford convertible--as a floating derrick dwarfs the tug which tows it.<br><br>Some of Father's friends used to come by now and again to watch our progress. They never said much, but when they went away it was with much thoughtful shakings of their heads.<br><br>Perhaps our caravan was no thing of beauty, but she was at least a thing of comfort. My father was an ingenious builder and he had fitted her cabin with every nautical convenience. There was a compact galley with a primus stove on gimbals, gimbaled lamps, great quantities of locker space, stowage for charts, a Seth Thomas chronometer on the forward bulkhead, two luxurious berths for my parents, and a folding pipe-berth for me. Dishes, our many books, and other loose oddments were neatly and securely racked in fitted cupboards so that even in the wildest weather they could not come adrift.<br><br>It was as well that my father took such pains to make the interior seaworthy, for, as we headed westward, we discovered that our wheeled vessel was--as sailors say--more than somewhat crank. Slab-sided and immense, she was the prey of every wind that blew. When a breeze took her from the flank she would sway heavily and, as like as not, scuttle ponderously to the wrong side of the road, pushing poor Eardlie with her. A head wind would force Eardlie into second gear and even then he would have to strain and boil furiously to keep headway on his balky charge. A stern wind was almost as bad, for then the great bulk of the tow would try to override the little car and, failing in this, would push Eardlie forward at speeds which chilled my mother's heart.<br><br>All in all it was a memorable journey for an eight-year-old boy. I had my choice of riding in Eardlie's rumble seat, where I became the gunner in a Sopwith Camel; or I could ride in the caravan itself and pilot my self-contained rocket into outer space. I preferred the caravan, for it was a private world and a brave one. My folding bunk-bed was placed high up under the rear window, and here I could lie--carefully strapped into place against the effect of negative gravity (and high winds)--and guide my spaceship through the void to those far planets known as Ohio, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and North Dakota.</p><h2>The Florida Keys</h2><p><b>The Florida Keys: A History &amp; Guide</b> is a smart, stylish handbook to one of the most unique locales in America. <b>The Florida Keys</b>--an unlikely sprinkling of coral and limestone islands that curve southwest from the tip of Florida--have always been engagingly different. Here, author Joy Williams, whose novels and short stories have won wide literary acclaim, shares with us all of the region's idiosyncrasies and delights.<br><br>From the diving and fishing meccas of Key Largo and Marathon to the funkiness and sophistication of Key West to the remote outpost of Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas,<b> The Florida Keys</b> serves the traveler as a witty and informative companion. Sensitive to and knowledgeable about the natural beauties of the Keys, Williams covers the exquisite underwater world of North America's only living reef and the eerie and delicate serenity of the "backcountry" of Florida Bay. <b>The Florida Keys</b> also provides fresh, up-to-date advice on the practicalities of where to stay, eat, and wander. Here is the quirkiest, most candid, and most literate guide to the Keys.</p><p><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br><br>The Florida Keys do not run due south. They drift southwest, Route 1 running more east-west than north-south. The Gulf side is actually Florida Bay, the upper reaches of which belong to the Everglades. The Bay side is called the "backcountry" or "outback." The Atlantic side is actually the Straits of Florida, where wide Hawk Channel runs out from shore to the reef, which stretches the length of the Keys. Beyond the reef is the Gulf Stream--"out front"-that great oceanic river whose demarcation is clearly seen, the water being a profound and fabulous blue. Beyond the Gulf Stream lies, then, the ocean. <br><br>The Keys run from Biscayne Bay to the Dry Tortugas, a distance of some 180 miles. No road runs to the keys north of Key Largo-Sands, Elliott, and Old Rhodes-and the Tortugas are 70 watery, wild miles from Key West. The distance accessible by car is some 106 miles-from Key Largo to Key West. That road, originally built in the 1930s, replaced Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Extension railroad line, an amazing piece of engineering which had linked the Keys since 1912 and which was destroyed by a hurricane in 1935. The mile markers (MM #-) referred to in this guide-green signs with white numerals, posted on the right-hand shoulder-were first placed along the Keys by the railroad. <br><br>On a map the Keys look fairly improbable-and Route 1, the line that drops down their sprinkled length, improbable too. The possibilities are vast, but the road itself is simple, which explains why some travelers begin at Key Largo, hang on to the steering wheel, and don't stop until Key West, heeding the billboards' urging, GO ALL THE WAY, with all its attendant, randy implications of reckless fulfillment. Other travelers arrive in the Keys, love them, stick close to Islamorada, and wouldn't dream of going all the way, considering Key West weird if not bizarre, as though that singular and raffish place were at the bottom of an ever-darkening well. <br><br>But of course the Keys don't really go from light to dark. The Keys sparkle downward, warm and bright, full of light and air and a bit of intrigue. The Keys are relaxed, a little reckless. The Keys are water and sky, horizon, daybreak, spectacular sunsets, the cup of night. The least interesting thing about them is the road, but the road, as is its nature, allows entrance. The road is the beginning. <br><br>There are some automobile guides, such as the old Sanborn Guides to Mexico, that are wonderfully jittery backseat companions, not pointing out cathedrals and markets (because the route in question is manifestly lacking in cathedrals and markets) but taking great pains to point out everything else. A child selling an iguana is here; half a kilometer down the road you will pass a most peculiarly shaped boulder; a bit beyond that there was once a Pemex station, though unfortunately a Pemex station is no longer there, only a tire dump; two kilometers away the road curves.... And so on. <br><br>The Keys once lent themselves to this sort of innocent treatment, and in a way they still do. There is the road, and there are the dutiful descending markers accompanying your every mile, suggesting that a trip is little more than coloring your own experience between provided lines. At MM #- there is an egret; at MM #- there's a pretty view between two violet jacaranda trees; at MM #-, if you can wait that long, is a bar where the bartender wears live snakes wrapped around her neck and wrists-her "pretties," she calls them.... And so on. <br><br>Time passes, of course. The snake lady is run over one night as she is crossing the road. Someone builds his dream house in front of the pretty view, cutting down the jacaranda trees in the process. But the Keys, though no longer the empty, silent stretches they once were, still markedly lack (you might as well be told) historical and cultural monuments. And the osprey still builds his nest larger each year at MM # . And the tarpon still roll and flash each spring under the bridge at MM # <br><br>And certainly at MM #- the disreputable bar remains. The best way to enjoy the Keys is still to seek out their simplicity and their eccentricity. <br><br>The Keys had been largely ignored until the 1970s, the lack of fresh water being the real inhibitor to development. The Navy had built an 18-inch pipeline in 1942 that ran the 130 miles from the Everglades wells in Florida City to Key West. The water took a week to travel the route. In 1982 the old pipe was replaced with a 36-inch pipe, increasing the quantity fourfold, providing indeed an oversupply of water and accelerating building and population growth. Oddly, the pipeline, as well as the construction of new bridges and wider roads, took place seven years after the state had designated Monroe County, which is the Keys, an "area of critical state concern" in an attempt to slow development (a perfectly nice word that unfortunately has been stolen away-undoubtedly while we were not looking-by the developers). In the 1980s realtors dressed up in wood rat costumes and organized motorcades and rallies to protest new state guidelines that would restrict development in the Keys. It's true. People who felt themselves endangered by environmental laws dressed up like the cotton mouse and the wood rat-present inhabitants of mangrove swamp and hammock--and, aroused by lawyers and politicians, made a long, noisy trip down the highway to Key West, where the governor was speaking, picking up additional incensed rat- and mouse-garbed people along the way. This was typical oddball Keys, but in this case, peculiarity had a threateningly modern and consumptive edge, which is familiarly Floridian. <br><br>W. C. Barron, the founder of Wall Street's Barron's, said early in this century that the only values in the state of Florida are the values created by man. This was how the state was perceived by the wealthy who came from elsewhere to exploit it. Florida, that splendid, subtle, once fabulous state, has been exploited, miscomprehended and misused, drained and diked, filled in and paved over. The values of man have been imposed with a vengeance. <br><br>Half of the historic Everglades is now farms, groves, and cities, and this marvelous ecosystem isn't working anymore. Over the last 50 years, 90 percent of the 'Glades' wading-bird population has been lost. To read the roll of its endangered species is heartbreaking. The reef is becoming increasingly stressed by sewage that flows quickly through the porous rock of the Keys and into the ocean, as well as by agricultural runoff from the mainland that gets dumped into Florida Bay from the Everglades. The rat-garbed protesters of the '80s recrudesced in the '90s as noisy foes of the National Marine Sanctuary, a designation conceived in 1990 that would protect and preserve the waters around the Keys, which need every bit of protection and preservation that they can get. <br><br>In 1996, in a nonbinding referendum, Keys residents voted 55 percent to 45 percent against the final Sanctuary plan. The plan had been five years in the making, during which time it underwent extensive public review. There were fears of a federal takeover, fears that people's property rights would be stripped away, despite the fact that the Sanctuary was intended to protect water-specifically 2,800 square miles of water from Key Largo to the Dry Tortugas. It was not designed to protect a pristine ecosystem, but rather as an emergency measure to prolong the life of an already impaired environment. Because of local public concerns, only one half of 1 percent of the Sanctuary waters have their use restricted-such as "no take" zones-compared with the original proposal of 14 percent. Even a half percent was too much sanctuary for the opponents who urged voters through print and radio ads not to "surrender." The Sanctuary, despite the local vote, was endorsed by the state and implemented. Its one half of 1 percent of restricted use survived further cuts and will be monitored as a research and replenishment preserve. <br><br>The bill is coming. It's not like the bill from a wonderful restaurant, Louie's, for example. It's not the bill for the lovely fresh snapper, the lovely wines, the lovely brownie with bourbon ice cream and caramel sauce at the lovely table beside the lovely sea. It's the bill for all our environmental mistakes of the past. The big bill. <br><br>"Keys" comes from the Spanish word cayos, for "little islands." The Keys are little, and they are fragile. They cannot sustain any more "dream houses" or "dream resorts." The sustaining dream is in the natural world-the world that each of us should respect, enjoy, and protect so that it may be enjoyed again-the world to which one can return and be refreshed. <br><br>Time passes. There are more of the many, and they want too much. What the traveler wants, of course, is not development but adventure, and this is still possible in the Keys. The Keys have always been different. May they remain that way.

And Adam will understand that having a police captain for a mother and a retired government spy living next door are not just the facts of his life but the keys to his survival, in <i>The Rule of Three </i>by Eric Walters.</p></p><p><p><b>Eric Walters</b>, a former elementary-school teacher, is a bestselling children's author in Canada. He is the founder of Creation of Hope, which provides care for orphans in the Makueni district of Kenya, and lives in Mississauga, Ontario.</p><p>1</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you keyboard a little bit faster?&#x201d; Todd asked.</p><p>We were in the computer room during study hall, our second-to-last class of the day. Not exactly where I wanted to be, but there were worse places to be than hanging with my best friend&#x2014;even if we were working on <i>his</i> essay.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the speed of my fingers that&#x2019;s slowing us down. I can only type what you say. And you&#x2019;re not saying anything,&#x201d; I answered.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, Adam, I&#x2019;m counting on you to fill in the blanks on this thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s <i>your</i> essay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want me to pass?&#x201d; Todd cajoled.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I want you to pass.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then you&#x2019;d better get busy, because that whole <i>passing</i> thing isn&#x2019;t likely to happen if you don&#x2019;t contribute.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t need my help if you didn&#x2019;t wait until the last minute to do your homework, you slacker,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;It is <i>not</i> the last minute. This isn&#x2019;t due until final period.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which is in forty minutes,&#x201d; I replied.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s my point. It won&#x2019;t be the <i>last</i> minute until thirty-nine minutes from now. If I handed it in <i>now</i>, technically it would be <i>early</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>This was Todd logic at its finest. He was almost impossible to reason with but totally impossible not to have a laugh with. The freshman girls seated on either side of us in the computer lab seemed to agree as they started giggling.</p><p>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t encourage him,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;And now you don&#x2019;t want me to be encouraged. What sort of best friend are you?&#x201d; Todd demanded. &#x201c;If you ladies want to offer me encouragement, please feel free.&#x201d;</p><p>They giggled again. This was obviously becoming more about him trying to impress them and less about helping me help him avoid flunking another assignment.</p><p>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you just do this last night?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I was worn out from football practice. Physically and mentally. You&#x2019;d have been worn out, too, if you hadn&#x2019;t quit the team.&#x201d;</p><p>I snorted. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t <i>quit</i>. I just didn&#x2019;t try out this year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Same thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the same thing. I chose flying lessons over football.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of normal sixteen-year-old chooses flying lessons over anything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One who wants to be a pilot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just like Daddy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; My father was a commercial pilot for Delta. He had been in uniform at the breakfast table and said he was heading to O&#x2019;Hare this morning. I knew he would be taking off on his return flight soon, so he&#x2019;d be home in time to read with the twins before they went to bed.</p><p>&#x201c;Personally, I&#x2019;d rather be like your mother,&#x201d; Todd said.</p><p>&#x201c;My mother is a woman,&#x201d; I pointed out. &#x201c;And I gotta tell you that picturing you in a dress, heels, and makeup is a bit unnerving.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;First off, I want to be a police officer, like your mother. Second, the idea that you are picturing me in a dress, makeup, and heels is <i>more</i> than a bit unnerving,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Just how long have you been fantasizing about me as a woman?&#x201d;</p><p>Once Todd got started it was hard to turn him off.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me!&#x201d; Todd called out. Everybody in the lab turned to face him. &#x201c;How many people find it disturbing that Adam has been picturing me as a woman?&#x201d;</p><p>Lots of hands went up.</p><p>&#x201c;Ignore him, please!&#x201d; I protested.</p><p>&#x201c;Adam, don&#x2019;t be ashamed, embrace your feelings!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me know when you&#x2019;re done, Todd.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In this day and age it&#x2019;s important that all of us accept you for what you are and how you feel. In fact, I take it as a compliment that you fantasize about me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t fantasize about you!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be embarrassed. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re not the only one who fantasizes about me.&#x201d; He turned to the girl on one side. &#x201c;Right? You must admit I&#x2019;ve entered your dream world at least once or twice.&#x201d;</p><p>She stopped laughing and looked like she was choking on something.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be shy,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Embrace your feelings, too. <i>Live</i> the fantasy and you could become part of the total Todd experience.&#x201d;</p><p>She turned beet red, gathered up her things, and practically ran away. The other two girls beside us pretended to ignore us now.</p><p>&#x201c;Nice,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Mean, possibly. Fun, tremendously. That&#x2019;s why God created high school&#x2014;so kids in older grades could torment kids in younger grades.&#x201d;</p><p>I knew that Todd could be neither embarrassed nor contained. He was as relentless as an avalanche. All I could do was redirect him.</p><p>&#x201c;Since when did you decide you wanted to be a police officer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Recently. I decided it would be cool to run around with a gun,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;The fact that you don&#x2019;t have a gun right now is at least a small blessing for all of us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll ignore that crack&#x2014;but if I had a gun I would force you to play football.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like I said, I have no time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could have time for both football and flying lessons if you didn&#x2019;t <i>waste</i> so much time on school. That&#x2019;s <i>my</i> solution.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And just how is that working out for you?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;It would be going extremely well if <i>somebody</i> would stop giving me a hard time and help me finish up this essay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just get it finished. I have to get out of here right after school. I have a flight lesson.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, Orville Wright,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, better Orville Wright than Orville Redenbacher. Three more lessons and then I solo.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When you get your license, do you know who I want to be the very first person up in the air with you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking anybody <i>except</i> me!&#x201d;</p><p>The two girls to my left started giggling again&#x2014;as well as a couple of other people in the lab.</p><p>&#x201c;You better not insult the man who has your future at his fingertips or&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The lights suddenly went out, the computer screen went blank, and everybody in the lab collectively groaned as we were thrown into darkness.</p><p>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; I wondered.</p><p>&#x201c;Power failure or something. More important, did you at least save my essay?&#x201d; Todd questioned.</p><p>&#x201c;I saved it . . . a few minutes ago. It&#x2019;s almost all there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I need <i>all</i> of it there! What am I going to tell Mr. Dixon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll tell him about the power failure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t believe me!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course he&#x2019;ll believe you. The lights are out everywhere, so I think he might have noticed.&#x201d; I gestured to the darkened hall. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t just a power failure in the computer lab. Besides, I&#x2019;m sure everything will be back on soon,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Soon may not be soon enough, and he won&#x2019;t believe me that it was almost done. You have to tell him!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll believe <i>you</i>! You hand in your assignments on time, you never skip class, you do your reading, and you&#x2019;re always polite to teachers. You are <i>such</i> a suck-up!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s called being responsible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Suck-up . . . responsible . . . different words for basically the same&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, my computer is down, too,&#x201d; the girl beside us said.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Everybody&#x2019;s</i> computer went off,&#x201d; Todd said. &#x201c;Computers need a magical substance called <i>electricity</i>.&#x201d; He turned to me. &#x201c;Today&#x2019;s younger generation doesn&#x2019;t understand much.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I understand that this is my laptop and it has a battery,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;The battery must be dead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But mine went down as well,&#x201d; another boy said.</p><p>&#x201c;Mine, too,&#x201d; a girl at the other end of the lab added. All of them were on laptops.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s because . . .&#x201d; Todd turned to me. &#x201c;Well, Adam?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How should I know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you win the science fair last year?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That was for designing a two-seated ultralight, not because I know everything about electricity.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, you know everything about everything. I wouldn&#x2019;t let you do my homework if you didn&#x2019;t. Can we go and find Mr. Dixon and explain to him about my paper?&#x201d;</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t going to do that. But I did want to see what was going on. I gave a big sigh and got to my feet.</p><p>_______________</p><p>The halls were filling with kids. The only light was coming from classroom windows and scattered emergency lights running on batteries. Classes had ended unexpectedly, and everyone was streaming out. There was a lot of laughing and loud conversation as kids enjoyed an early break.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I have your attention, please!&#x201d; a deep voice boomed. &#x201c;Please, everybody, stop where you are!&#x201d; It was our vice principal yelling through a handheld bullhorn. &#x201c;We need everybody in the gym for a brief assembly!&#x201d;</p><p>There were groans from the crowd.</p><p>&#x201c;I say we head for the doors,&#x201d; Todd said. &#x201c;In this commotion there&#x2019;s no way they&#x2019;re going to be able to stop us from leaving.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about the assembly?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you wonder why I call you a suck-up?&#x201d;</p><p>We headed down the stairs, only to find two teachers at the exit deflecting the river of students toward the gym.</p><p>&#x201c;So much for leaving,&#x201d; I said. I knew Todd was disappointed, but I really did want to hear what they had to tell us.</p><p>We went with the flow. The gym was dimly lit with just a&nbsp;few emergency lights. It was already crowded, and I felt a little claustrophobic as we pushed in. The bleachers were filled to capacity and we were herded onto the court, shoulder to shoulder. I was grateful to be taller than most everybody else. Did they really think they could cram fifteen hundred kids into this space?</p><p>&#x201c;My phone isn&#x2019;t working,&#x201d; Todd said.</p><p>&#x201c;You know there are lots of dead spots in this school.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I mean it&#x2019;s as blank as the computer screens.&#x201d; He showed it to me.</p><p>&#x201c;Your battery is dead. Your phone needs that magical substance called electricity to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My phone is dead, too,&#x201d; a girl said.</p><p>&#x201c;Same here,&#x201d; somebody else added.</p><p>All around us people who had overheard were pulling out their phones. There was a chorus of disbelief and upset. It was strange how they seemed more upset about their phones not working than there being no electricity.</p><p>I pulled out my phone, just to confirm things. It was off&#x2014;as per the school rules&#x2014;but when I pushed the button to turn it on, it remained blank. I knew my phone was fully charged. The cell phone towers probably needed electricity to work. Is that why we weren&#x2019;t even getting a screen? No, that didn&#x2019;t make sense. Even without the towers there should have been power to run other apps.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I have your attention!&#x201d; Our principal was on the stage with a bullhorn. &#x201c;Please!&#x201d; he called out. &#x201c;We need everybody to listen carefully . . . Please stop talking!&#x201d;</p><p>There was a murmur of conversation that faded to a semisilence, an acceptable level of cooperation.</p><p>&#x201c;As you are all aware, we have a power failure,&#x201d; he started. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re assuming that it&#x2019;s probably countywide, as there is a complete breakdown in telephone service, both landlines and cell phones, which must be related to the power failure.&#x201d;</p><p>The crowd noise went up as those who hadn&#x2019;t noticed previously all pulled out their cell phones to confirm what he&#x2019;d said.</p><p>&#x201c;Quiet down, people! The sooner we can finish here, the sooner you can all go home!&#x201d;</p><p>A cheer went up from the crowd and then applause.</p><p>&#x201c;Silence, please!&#x201d; The noise faded. &#x201c;Whatever the issue is, I&#x2019;m confident it is being addressed and will be corrected shortly.&#x201d;</p><p>For some reason I had a feeling it wasn&#x2019;t going to be so simple. I was still thinking about why the batteries in the laptops had gone dead.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve decided to cancel final period today and let you all go home early.&#x201d;</p><p>A cheer went up from the audience once again.</p><p>He raised a hand to quiet everyone. &#x201c;You can stay here in the gym to wait for the buses. If you&#x2019;re driving or walking, keep in mind there will probably be no functioning traffic lights, so please be careful. Dismissed.&#x201d;</p><p>There was an even bigger cheer as we all started for the exits.</p></p><h2>Official Saga Frontier Strategy Guide</h2><p><ul> <li>The BradyGames SaGa Frontier strategy guide includes lists of all the weapons, magic and bestiary</li> <li>Complete walkthroughs for each of the characters</li> <li>Learn how to play the game to enjoy a multitude of different endings</li> <li>SaGa Frontier is the fourth and latest extension of the popular Romancing SaGa series</li> <li>With its rich and deeply textured 3D environments and its Free Scenario System from the previous Romancing SaGa titles, SaGa Frontier provides players with a great deal of freedom when choosing their own paths of exploration and discovery</li> <li>The game features a large cast of main and sub-characters, in which the player will have the option to choose between seven main characters</li> </ul></p><p>An epic book for another epic role-playing game from Squaresoft, this exhaustive guide provides everything you need to know about <i>SaGa Frontier</i>.

In works such as Rigoletto, Il trovatore, La traviata, and Aida, Verdi developed the musical language of Romanticism in a way that still speaks to listeners around the world.<br>Born in 1813 in a village near Parma, Verdi was the son of an obscure innkeeper. His musical talent was soon obvious, and at the age of nine he became the organist at the village church. Denied entrance to the conservatory in Milan, he studied privately instead and soon had an opera accepted for production at La Scala. His third opera, Nabucco, made him famous throughout Italy; with his fifth, Ernani, he became a celebrity throughout Europe and his career was on its way. At the height of his success came works like Il trovatore, the most popular opera all over the world for the better part of the 1850's.<br>Tragedy struck early in Verdi's life when he lost his young wife and both children to illness within a three-year period. Later, he became involved with the singer Giuseppina Strepponi and scandalized provincial society by living with her for ten years before they married. But above all else, the story of Verdi's life is the story of his work; he was still challenging himself to expand his artistic horizons at the age of 79, when he completed his last opera, Falstaff.<br>Julian Budden's Verdi first traces the composer's life story, then provides illuminating commentary on each of the works. Appendices include a chronology, a list of works, a "who's who", and a select bibliography. A special feature of Verdi is a glossary of nineteenth-century opera terms, explaining words such as "cabaletta" and "cavatina" that are often used in writing about opera but seldom clearly defined.</p><p></p><h2>The Secret of the Universe (Janus Series)</h2><p>Dual language edition (original Latin as originally printed verso facing authoritative English translation of same page recto).<br><br>Translated by A.M.

The remedy pictures and symptoms were intuited, channelled or experienced physically, emotionally and spiritually. They include the usual mental and physical symptoms of a remedy but also its spiritual aspects and the way in which it can be used to clear psychic or spiritual blocks and to further spiritual development. Each remedy is also linked with the chakras. These are remedies which will be increasingly needed as we move into the 21st century and the Aquarian Age, especially by children but they are already found to work well in the treatment of physical and emotional dis-ease in anyone. The provings bring to the forefront the spiritual potential of Homeopathy and give to practitioners and patients who are ready and willing to work at this level the possibility of using homeopathy as a tool for spiritual advancement. Many of the old remedies do not have this aspect as they were needed at a time when the level of humanity&#39;s development was different. However many of the old remedies also work at this higher level when needed, especially when given in combination with the new remedies.</p><p></p><h2>Soldiers Lost at Sea: A Chronicle of Troopship Disasters in Wartime</h2><p><p>Heroism, tragedy, devotion to duty, and scandal are just a few of the ingredients that make up this dramatic first-time account of troopship losses in wartime. International in scope, it offers a compilation of stories about historic troopship disasters caused by torpedoes, aerial attacks, mines, surface fire, foul weather, friendly fire, and poor planning by military decision makers. Some are well known, like the explosion of the steamship <i>Sultana</i> on the Mississippi while transporting 2,000 Union soldiers home from Confederate prisons. Others, like the June 1945 sinking of the Japanese cruiser <i>Ashigara</i> by a British submarine that resulted in the loss of 800 Japanese soldiers, are little known. An extraordinary few far surpass the authors' criteria for selection of disasters with high troop loss and the involvement of heroic acts. Among the most memorable is the 1851 sinking of the British frigate <i>Birkenhead</i> with some 600 soldiers and their wives and children aboard. Lacking sufficient lifeboats, the men stood steady in their ranks on deck as the ship went down.</p><br><p>Board of Inquiry hearings, action reports, survivor debriefings, and personal correspondence collected from archives in Germany, Italy, Russia, Australia, Britain, and the United States tell the story of some fifty vessels that went down. Many of these disasters, the authors explain, were kept secret for decades. An introductory chapter provides an overview of troop losses at sea beginning with the age of galley warfare, but the majority of the book focuses on losses of World War II Allied and Axis ships followed by incidents from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p></p><p>James E.

Reprint.</p><p>James Cowan&#39;s fantasy of a Venetian cartographer owes a large and obvious debt to Borges, with its speculations on geography as a construct of the human consciousness, its erudite references, and its tales of explorations into an imaginary world. Through the purported journals of Fra Mauro, a cloistered monk who actually lived during the 15th century and who, in Cowan&#39;s novel, has resolved to create a map of the world without ever leaving his cell, we learn of a race of men with one foot the size of an umbrella, about the Vatican emissary to the Mongol court,and about the devil worshippers of the land called Mosul. Over the course of the book, Fra Mauro creates a world of his own, composed less of geographical knowledge than of meditation, folklore, and books.James Cowan is the author of more than twenty books, including <i>Francis: A Saint's Way </i> and the best-selling <i>A Mapmaker's Dream</i>, for which he was awarded the Australian Literature Society's Gold Medal.

The translucent-looking, sun-struck, golden woman in the bathtub--the artist's wife and favorite model--is so emblazoned on our memories that it takes an exhibition like the one documented in this book to remind viewers of Bonnard's extraordinary range as a colorist.<p> The early, intimate, Nabi paintings are often dark, with figures that stand out like candle flames in shadowy interiors. But Bonnard's use of umber, sienna, and various blacks--occasionally in the shape of a dachshund--is forever part of what makes those brilliant reds and oranges sing. Even 60 years into his career, the painter gave full range to his palette, balancing the most highly colored canvasses with others of pale, soft grays. Those readers who have been succored on the 1984 Phillips Collection catalogue will find MoMA's new one every bit as nourishing.</p>In meticulous, often scientific, detail he decodes Bonnard's use of color, perspective and other devices in his optical bag of tricks. -- <i><i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, Scott Veale</i></p><h2>Sampler View Of Colonial Life</h2><p>This look at day-to-day Colonial life as seen through the samplers that were stitched by girls contains detailed projects, from weaving the cloth for a sampler to creating a sampler on the computer.</p><p></p><h2>What Plant Where</h2><p>Recommends perennials, climbers, shrubs, conifers, and trees by their characteristics, including size, soil and sunlight requirements, seasonal features, and color</p><p>Roy Lancaster worked at the University of Cambridge Botanic Gardens and the Hillier Nurseries in Hampshire before becoming the first curator of the Sir Harold Hillier Gardens and Arboretum in 1970. Since 1980 he has been a freelance writer, plant explorer, and broadcaster. He has written many books, including What Houseplant Where and What Perennial Where (also published by DK), and regularly contributes to various magazines, including the Royal Horticultural Society&#39;s journal The Garden.This resource book will provide guidance for gardeners who are making plant-purchasing decisions for garden sites by specific size of plants, soil conditions needed, amount of sunlight or shade, growing position, foliage color, season-specific features, growing sites, and special categories (e.g., fragrance, hedging screening, and berries for birds). An index grid leads the reader to a section of the book with specific plants for the category, e.g., perennials, climbers, shrubs, conifers, and trees, selected in the grid. The text by leading British garden writer Lancaster is expertly done. Along with hundreds of excellent color photos that illustrate the selected plant, the grower is given individual information on plant size, hardiness, and light requirements. While this guide seems most useful as a circulating book, some will think it should be relegated to the reference collection as it has the colorful DK reference aura. Regardless of where you keep it, this volume fills a niche in the plant collections in most libraries.?Dale Luchsinger, Athens Area Technical Inst., Ga.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Earth&#39;s Biosphere: Evolution, Dynamics, and Change</h2><p><b>Received Honorable Mention in the category of Geography and Earth Science in the 2002 Professional/Scholarly Publishing Annual Awards Competition presented by the Association of American Publishers, Inc. </b><br> <br> In his latest book, Vaclav Smil tells the story of the Earth's biosphere from its origins to its near- and long-term future. He explains the workings of its parts and what is known about their interactions. With essay-like flair, he examines the biosphere's physics, chemistry, biology, geology, oceanography, energy, climatology, and ecology, as well as the changes caused by human activity. He provides both the basics of the story and surprising asides illustrating critical but often neglected aspects of biospheric complexity.<br> <br> Smil begins with a history of the modern idea of the biosphere, focusing on the development of the concept by Russian scientist Vladimir Vernadsky. He explores the probability of life elsewhere in the universe, life's evolution and metabolism, and the biosphere's extent, mass, productivity, and grand-scale organization. Smil offers fresh approaches to such well-known phenomena as solar radiation and plate tectonics and introduces lesser-known topics such as the quarter-power scaling of animal and plant metabolism across body sizes and metabolic pathways. He also examines two sets of fundamental relationships that have profoundly influenced the evolution of life and the persistence of the biosphere: symbiosis and the role of life's complexity as a determinant of biomass productivity and resilience. And he voices concern about the future course of human-caused global environmental change, which could compromise the biosphere's integrity and threaten the survival of modern civilization.</p><p>Vaclav Smil is Distinguished Professor at the University of Manitoba and the author of many books, including <i>Energy at the Crossroads: Global Perspectives and Uncertainties</i> (2005), <i>Energy in Nature and Society: General Energetics of Complex Systems</i> (2007), <i>Global Catastrophes and Trends: The Next Fifty Years</i> (2008), and <i>Why America Is Not a New Rome</i> (2010), all published by the MIT Press. He was awarded the 2007 Olivia Schieffelin Nordberg Award for excellence in writing and editing in the population sciences."A lovely book, in both content and execution."<br> &#x2014; <b><b>Mitchell K.

The book can be viewed as an elaborate timeline for preparing for December 25--indeed, Martha claims the book was written and photographed in "real time" from the day after Thanksgiving through Christmas Day. Along the way, Martha teaches you how to make plum pudding, 24 different types of cookies, and a holiday party menu featuring cassoulet for 100. For Christmas Day dinner, a towering croquembouche is perhaps the finest culinary feature of the menu, which features roast ducklings with wild rice, chestnut, and cranberry dressing. Martha also provides tips on decorating trees, making ornaments, gift-wrapping papers, and making beautiful wreaths and topiaries. There's even advice on making up gift baskets of the cookies, conserves, and puddings that you've created yourself. Martha herself admits that "it's true, we did get carried away"--she creates an elaborate gingerbread mansion--but most of the recipes and crafts are easy to follow and produce great results. <i>Martha Stewart's Christmas</i> is a real gift. <i>C.B.

Some were well seated in the Confucian scholar tradition associated with the transmission of canonical writings such as the Neijing. Alongside and concurrent to these traditions China also had family lineages that were more or less kept as trade secrets among small groups of people. The Tung lineage of acupuncture was one such tradition that survives and even flourishes today. One special feature of Tung&#39;s system is that it uses hundreds of extra points not found in conventional acupuncture. Moreover, these points represent numerous microsystems over the entire body. This new book on Tung&#39;s ancient system presents a detailed look at these unique points. However, instead of just simply presenting Tung&#39;s points, it gives the reader a method of understanding how and when to use them in the modern clinic. The book also explores the links between Tung&#39;s points, conventional acupuncture points and channels, and their connections to the classics of Chinese medicine. It is a must have for both the beginning and advanced acupuncturist!</p><p></p><h2>American Masterworks: Houses of the Twentieth &amp; Twenty-first Centuries</h2><p>This beautiful, authoritative book celebrates great American residential design. Its wide-ranging content highlights the most important works by the influential architects of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Presented are approximately forty-five icons of modern architecture, including the Greene brothers&#x2019; arts-and-crafts Gamble House; Michael Graves&#x2019; neoclassical villa; Richard Neutra&#x2019;s California Modern Kaufmann House; and three Frank Lloyd Wright masterpieces: Fallingwater, and the Storer and Sturges houses, as well as masterpieces by Richard Meier, Frank Gehry, and Peter Eisenman. First published in 1995, this expanded and updated edition includes twelve important additions to the canon. Works by a new generation of influential architects include Zoka Zola&#x2019;s award-winning Pfanner House; Michael Bell&#x2019;s Binocular House; and Peter Bohlin&#x2019;s Ledge House. It is the ultimate compendium of great American house design.</p><p>Kenneth Frampton has authored numerous books including such Rizzoli titles as Richard Meier, Architect Vol. 3 and the three-volume Modern Architecture series, among others. He is the Ware Professor of Architecture at Columbia University. David Larkin is an editor and designer, whose previous Rizzoli books include Farmhouse, Barn, American Home, and The Treehouse Book.Frampton, professor of architecture at Columbia University, has teamed up with designer David Larkin to produce a fresh, knowledgeable, and visually exciting survey of the modern house in America--the modern house, that is, as a work of art. The 34 featured houses, presented in superb color photographs, truly are gems: cool, angular, pristine, and aristocratic. One of Frampton's criteria for selection stipulated that each house "possess a certain level of complexity and poetic depth." And indeed these houses do, although their complexity becomes all but invisible as we move forward in time. Frampton begins with the Greene and Greene Gamble House, built in Pasadena in 1908, a beautifully realized synthesis of Japanese aesthetics and the American arts and crafts movement. The Japanese influence is prevalent throughout the book, while the warmth of the craft movement quickly fades. The houses become increasingly grid oriented and more open to natural light and the surrounding landscape, so it's no surprise that most are found in California. The masters include Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson (the famous Glass House), Craig Ellwood, Louis Kahn, Paul Rudolph, Michael Graves, and Frank Gehry. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Starring the Baby-sitters Club (Baby-Sitters Club Super Special # 9)</h2><p>With Kristy in the title role in her school&#39;s production of &#34;Peter Pan,&#34; the show is certain to be a hit--until Dawn interrupts rehearsals with the charge that the play is sexist</p><p></p><h2>Tree by Tolkien (Yes!

The authors estimate that over 150,000 people will graduate from the Dale Carnegie course in the United States alone this year. Past graduates have included such notables as Lee Iacocca and Stew Leonard, the multi-millionaire businessman from New Jersey made famous in Tom Peters and Nancy Austin's A Passion for Excellence ( LJ 6/15/85). Kemp and Claflin include testimonies from Iacocca and Leonard on how the Carnegie course has made a positive impact on their lives. The authors also discuss how Carnegie's work has affected psychology, education, and the personal growth and self-help movements of today. This is a welcome addition to the history of American business. Recommended for public and academic libraries.<br><i>- Richard Paustenbaugh, Indiana Univ. Libs., Bloomington</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kemp, a marketing executive, and Claflin, author of You'll Never Get No for an Answer , cover the extraordinary life of Dale Carnegie (1888-1955), born to impoverished parents in Missouri farm country. A youth tempted to suicide by failures, Carnegie nevertheless kept seeking the key to success which he finally found and shared with other aspirants. The authors describe the Carnegie Course, subject of his bestselling How to Win Friends and Influence People , published in 1936. While the authors maintain that their book is not intended to promote the course, their reports on sessions in progress seem, perhaps inevitably, like endorsements. The book is, however, an interesting account of Carnegie the man and of his teaching, which combines elements of method acting and group encounters.

For 15 years, Quammen put these qualities to good use in his <i>Outside</i> magazine column "Natural Acts." <i>The Boilerplate Rhino</i> gathers 26 of those columns between book covers, and to good purpose: every one of them is a keeper. Quammen writes of such matters as the entirely reasonable human fear of spiders (which he shares) and snakes (which he does not); of the work of such groundbreaking theoreticians and thinkers as E.O. Wilson and Henry David Thoreau; of the history of American lawns; the life of the durian fruit; the commodification of nature by way of television documentaries; the strange scholarly fortunes of <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>; and the landing patterns of cats in free fall. (Really.) A single theme underpins these scattered pieces: namely, how humans "in all their variousness, regard and react to the natural world, in all its variousness." Quammen explores this theme with good cheer and hard-won knowledge, and his essays teach his readers much about the world. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>David Quammen is a regular contributor to Natural history magazines.

Through a series of brilliant epiphanies that parallel the development of his own aesthetic consciousness, Joyce evokes Stephen's youth, from his impressionable years as the youngest student at the Clongowed Wood school to the deep religious conflict he experiences at a day school in Dublin, and finally to his college studies where he challenges the conventions of his upbringing and his understanding of faith and intellectual freedom. James Joyce's highly autobiographical novel was first published in the United States in 1916 to immediate acclaim. Ezra Pound accurately predicted that Joyce's book would "remain a permanent part of English literature," while H.G. Wells dubbed it "by far the most important living and convincing picture that exists of an Irish Catholic upbringing." A remarkably rich study of a developing young mind, <i>A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man</i> made an indelible mark on literature and confirmed Joyce's reputation as one of the world's greatest and lasting writers.<p>Like much of James Joyce's work, <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> is a fictional re-creation of the Irish writer's own life and early environment. The experiences of the novel's young hero, Stephen Dedalus, unfold in astonishingly vivid scenes that seem freshly recalled from life and provide a powerful portrait of the coming of age of a young man of unusual intelligence, sensitivity, and character.<br>The interest of the novel is deepened by Joyce's telling portrayals of an Irish upbringing and schooling, the Catholic Church and its priesthood, Parnell and Irish politics, encounters with the conflicting roles of art and morality (problems that would follow Joyce throughout his life), sexual experimentation and its aftermath, and the decision to leave Ireland.<br>Rich in details that offer vital insights into Joyce's art, this masterpiece of semiautobiographical fiction remains essential reading in any program of study in modern literature.</p></p><h2>Retirement Homes Are Murder: A Paul Jacobson Mystery</h2><p>Used.

The instructions emphasize simplicity and logic, use common tools and easy-to-order materials, and provide resources for obtaining electronic components and other hardware. Understand every aspect of construction: body shape, bridge types, neck and headstock, cutting and shaping, and assembly. Both traditional and modern features are included, making the finished instrument perfect for whatever musical style you like best, whether it&#39;s classic rock or cool jazz.Do-it-yourself project books will always be popular with library patrons, and the "build your own guitar" field has gotten somewhat crowded. As useful as its predecessors, this work should be discussed in terms of its distinguishing features. Besides quality of production (it's printed entirely on heavy paper stock and features full-color photos throughout), it excels in the simplicity of its presentation: the instructions are logical and well detailed, and they promote use of common tools and easily acquired materials. In addition, the authors, both craftsmen and musicians, include methodology for constructing an electric bass guitar, which differs in degree from a six-string guitar and is usually not covered in books of this nature. Lastly, there is its affordability. Highly recommended for all woodworking collections. Eric C. Shoaf, Brown Univ.

He has become known as the &#x201c;Tracker&#x201d;&#x2014;a man who can find anything, can solve any puzzle and, with the help of his apprentice, Jack Tucker, an orphaned street urchin with a thief &#x2019;s touch&#x2014;will do so for a price. But this time, even Crispin is wary of taking on his most recent client. Jacob of Provencal is a Jewish physician at the King&#x2019;s court, even though all Jews were expelled from England nearly a century before. Jacob wants Crispin to find stolen parchments that might be behind the recent, ongoing, gruesome murders of young boys, parchments that someone might have used to bring forth a demon which now stalks the streets and alleys of London.</p><p>JERI WESTERSON is the author of two previous novels featuring Crispin Guest; <i>Veil of Lies </i>and <i>Serpent in the Thorns</i>. She is also a journalist and noted blogger on things mysterious and medieval. She lives in Menifee, California.1London, 1384<br>&#x201c;HE&#x2019;S STILL OUT THERE.&#x201d; Jack Tucker leaned his head and shoulders out the window.<br>&#x201c;Close the damn shutters,&#x201d; growled Crispin. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too cold in here as it is.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sorry, Master,&#x201d; said the boy, doing as bid. His ginger hair was dusted with snow. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that that man is still out there, looking up at us. Makes me a bit shivery.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The cold will do that.&#x201d; Hunkered by their meager fire, Crispin held one hand toward the flames. The other was curled around a bowl of tart wine.<br>&#x201c;He might be a client, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He might be.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you go look?&#x201d;<br>Crispin drank the bitter liquid. Winter did not seem to bring him as many clients as the warmer months. Perhaps fewer crimes were committed in the winter and a &#x201c;private sheriff&#x201d; was not in the family finances when it came down to it.<br>The small room offered little comfort. Its few bits of rented furniture&#x2014;a chair, a stool, a rickety table&#x2014;stood in the center of unadorned walls. Crispin&#x2019;s pallet bed was shoved against the wall near the hearth, and on the opposite side of the small fire lay a pile of straw, the place Jack tucked in at night. Four strides would take him to a chest by the door, which held Crispin&#x2019;s change of stockings and braies and his few writing implements. He was lucky to have two windows, one facing the back garden and the one Jack had been leaning out of facing the Shambles. But &#x201c;luck&#x201d; was a relative term. Today, with London chilled like a frozen lake, two windows only offered more opportunities for an icy draft.<br>&#x201c;Let me see, then.&#x201d; Crispin rose with a bone-weary sigh and set the empty bowl aside. He joined Jack by the window, but instead of throwing open the shutter, he peered down through a crack in the wood that he usually kept stuffed with a rag.<br>Below, in the snow-painted street, stood a man in a long black gown. His dark beard was salted by time as were his bushy brows. His head was covered by a tight-fitting felt cap with flaps that covered his ears. And he was looking up at Crispin&#x2019;s window expectantly, ignoring the occasional passerby in the street.<br>&#x201c;He certainly seems determined about something,&#x201d; said Crispin.<br>&#x201c;Then why don&#x2019;t he come up?&#x201d; asked the boy, twisting his cloak across his chest.<br>&#x201c;A very good question. Why don&#x2019;t you go down and find out.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; Suddenly the mystery did not need solving so urgently. &#x201c;He might be a madman. He&#x2019;s been there a straight hour and he hasn&#x2019;t moved.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All the more reason to see what he wants. Go on now, Jack. If apprentice you wish to be, then you had best obey your master.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I knew that would bite me in the arse,&#x201d; he grumbled. Securing his cloak, he marched toward the door. He took a firm grip of his knife sheath and looked Crispin in the eye. It was moments like these that Jack seemed so very young. Of course it was true. At twelve, his cheeks were still plump from childhood, and though his voice cracked a bit, it hadn&#x2019;t yet deepened. &#x201c;If I don&#x2019;t come back, it&#x2019;s your fault.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Shall I keep watch? Is an old man so much of a threat to you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going!&#x201d; he replied sullenly, and slipped through the door.<br>But Crispin did keep watch through the chink, and saw Jack appear cautiously below. The man tore his gaze at last from Crispin&#x2019;s second-storey window and stared at Jack. The creak of cart and hiss of wind made it impossible for Crispin to hear their quiet exchange, but he could well tell by Jack&#x2019;s pantomime what he told the man. He appeared to be entreating him upstairs, but the man shook his head. It seemed that he was content to stand in the snow and merely gaze up at the window.<br>Crispin studied the man anew. &#x201c;Hmpf. Now I grow curious.&#x201d;<br>Footsteps at his door told him Jack had returned. The door opened. &#x201c;Bless me,&#x201d; said Jack, shaking the flakes from his cloak and stamping at the threshold. &#x201c;He does want to talk to you, sir. But he will not come up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh? Does he say why?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, sir. He seems most stubborn about it. I told him that the Tracker was not in the habit of meeting strange men in the cold streets instead of his warm lodgings.&#x201d;<br>No, indeed. He had no wish to leave the feeble warmth of his room, but the larder was decidedly bare. &#x201c;It seems I have no choice but to humor this miscreant. Tell me, Jack. How did he seem to you? What was his character?&#x201d;<br>He knew the boy liked to show off his growing skills, and on cue, Jack puffed up and hooked his thumbs in his belt. &#x201c;Well, now. He is a man of middle years, well-spoken, neat and clean.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;London or foreign?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Foreign. French, I think. His speech has got a light touch, if you get my meaning. He seems like a gentleman.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then he&#x2019;ll have the coin. Very well. I shall meet this mysterious man on the street.&#x201d; Crispin buttoned his cloak tight, pulled his chaperon hood up over his head, and yanked open the frost-bitten door.<br>He trotted down the narrow stairwell, mindful of the icy last step, and when he reached the lane, he studied the man with steel-gray eyes. The man turned and measured Crispin but did not approach. Instead, he bowed. &#x201c;Do I have the pleasure of meeting the great Crispin Guest?&#x201d; The accent was soft but unmistakably French.<br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Great&#x2019; is a matter of perspective. But Crispin Guest I am. And you, sir? You find your occupation by staring at my window. To what end?&#x201d;<br>The man took a step closer. Crispin eyed his gown, a dark woolen robe cut in solemn lines and trimmed with black fur. His skin was pale and his beard grew past his chin but was not long enough to graze his chest. There, on the breast of his gown, Crispin observed something unexpected: a round, yellow patch carefully stitched into place.<br>The man saw Crispin eye it but did not comment. &#x201c;My name is Jacob of Proven�al.&#x201d; He stepped closer. &#x201c;I am a physician. From the continent.&#x201d;<br>Crispin said nothing, waiting.<br>The man continued. &#x201c;I have heard others speak of you, of this &#x2018;Tracker.&#x2019; You find things. Lost things.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Indeed. It is my bread and butter.&#x201d; His stomach took that moment to growl. The tips of his ears warmed.<br>The man smiled. &#x201c;En effet. I am looking for a most important object. A dangerous one. It must be found before, well, it simply must. I beg that you come to my lodgings and we shall discuss it there.&#x201d;<br>Crispin turned an eye to his window, knowing well Jack was spying on them. &#x201c;And where are your lodgings?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;At court.&#x201d;<br>He hadn&#x2019;t meant to, but Crispin stiffened. The man watched him with a judicious eye. &#x201c;I . . . have also heard,&#x201d; the man said carefully, &#x201c;that you may not be welcomed there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;An understatement. It would be difficult my going to King Richard&#x2019;s palace. But I know of another place that might suit. Someplace closer. Will you permit me to lead you to an alehouse?&#x201d;<br>The man hesitated. He pressed a pale finger to his lip and glanced up at Crispin&#x2019;s shuttered window before he lowered his head. He muttered something under his breath and lifted his face. &#x201c;Very well, then. Lead me.&#x201d;<br>Crispin tramped through the slushy snow with rag-stuffed boots. He did not wait for the sound of the man&#x2019;s footfalls behind him, though they came anyway in a faint and reluctant step.<br>He tried to tread into the already dark hoof marks carved into the snowy streets, but his stride was not as long as the draft horses, and his boots were soaked and cold by the time he made the turn at the corner to Gutter Lane where the Boar&#x2019;s Tusk cast its weighty shadow across the road. When he came to the door he waited. The man approached and Crispin opened it, gesturing him through. Crispin followed him in and the warmth, which his own humble lodgings lacked, clapped his cold cheeks hard. He felt his bones thaw as he moved into the dim room to find his usual seat near the fire, his back to the wall and facing the door. He gestured for the man to sit opposite him.<br>Jacob gathered his cloak and gown around him and sat gingerly on the bench.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t long before a plump matron came to their table with a sweating jug in one hand and two clay bowls in the other. &#x201c;Crispin,&#x201d; she said with a wide smile.<br>&#x201c;Eleanor.&#x201d; Seeing her warm and friendly face touched off a spark of warmth within him. She and her husband, Gilbert, owned the Boar&#x2019;s Tusk. They were the first to befriend him since he came to the Shambles some seven years ago.<br>&#x201c;Will you share wine with me, Master Jacob?&#x201d; said Crispin to the wary man.<br>Jacob shook his head and squinted at Eleanor&#x2019;s expression. &#x201c;I mean no offense to this good woman here, or to her establishment. But I may not partake of anything . . . here.&#x201d;<br>Crispin&#x2019;s eyes flicked to that yellow rouelle on the man&#x2019;s breast once more before settling on his lined and drawn face.<br>Flushed, Eleanor merely poured a bowl for Crispin and left the jug before she scooted away. Crispin surveyed the room of uneven wooden tables with their hard-worn benches and stools, scouting for familiar faces or eavesdroppers. Some tables were lit with candles, their greasy odor lifting and blending with the smells of toasting logs, roasted meats, and sweaty woolens. There were few patrons this afternoon. It was too cold to venture forth other than to earn one&#x2019;s daily wage. Yet Crispin usually found himself in his favorite tavern each day. Little wonder his funds were low when he insisted on his wine.<br>He took up the bowl, silently saluted his companion, and drank. The wine was slightly bitter, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. It warmed him and dulled the ache in his heart when he considered his empty money pouch and the depths he had to plumb to fill it.<br>Jacob hunkered in his robes and surveyed the other patrons with a wince of disdain. &#x201c;We are quite alone, Master Jacob,&#x201d; said Crispin between quaffs. He poured more into the bowl and set both jug and cup on the table, turning the cup slowly with his fingertips. &#x201c;What is it you wish to tell me?&#x201d;<br>Jacob canted closer to the table and placed both arms on its surface. He clasped his long, pale fingers together. &#x201c;Ma�tre Guest, I have heard many rumors as concerns you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Could any of them possibly be true?&#x201d; He smirked and drank another dose.<br>&#x201c;I come from afar, Ma�tre. But even I have heard of the Tracker . . . a man who was once a traitor.&#x201d;<br>Seven years had passed yet still he hated the term. He gripped the bowl. &#x201c;Traitor I was, sir, though I do not boast in it. I am alive. I do not boast in that either, for that circumstance can surely change with the season.&#x201d;<br>The man eased back. His eyes darted about the room, wary.<br>Crispin&#x2019;s gaze fell again to the yellow patch on the man&#x2019;s chest and could not help the welling of mistrust in his breast. &#x201c;May I ask?&#x201d;<br>Jacob sat very still. Robes gathered protectively about him, he seemed more chrysalis than man.<br>Crispin did not mince words. &#x201c;Why is a Jewish physician called to England&#x2019;s court?&#x201d;<br>The man smiled cautiously. His gaze rested steadily on Crispin&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Why indeed? To a place where Jews are unwelcome? In fact, so unwelcome that your king made it illegal for Jews to reside here generations ago.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; An unnamed discomfort flushed Crispin&#x2019;s body. The Jews of England were exiled well before his time and he had been spared congress with them. It was said they had lived in Camden, but if they had, there was little trace there now. What remained was the old Domus Conversorum on Chancery Lane, the place where the converted Jews lived under the grace of old King Henry of Winchester, the father of Edward Longshanks, who expelled them at last. Jews were outlawed from entering England and it was a just law, although there was the occasional new inhabitant to the Domus, those traveling Jews who had come to their senses.<br>Crispin had been to the Holy Land, seen Saracens and Jews, and their ways were too foreign, too disturbing to his Christian sensibilities. To be sitting with a Jew now in his favorite tavern made him itch to leave. Even so, the man&#x2019;s demeanor was respectful and cautious. He seemed to know well how he stood and was almost amused by it. &#x201c;And so,&#x201d; Crispin pursued. &#x201c;Why are you here? At court, no less?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My specialty was desired. If I may be bold,&#x201d; he said, his white hand pressed to his breast and his head bowed. &#x201c;My services are well known far from France. Your king has permitted me passage here to serve the queen.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Eh? I was not aware that our queen was ill.&#x201d;<br>The man merely blinked. His rosy lips pressed closed and would divulge no more.<br>Crispin poured more wine, took up his bowl, and drank it down. The warm buzz he sought had settled pleasantly into his head. &#x201c;And so, our King Richard allows a Jew to live in his palace.&#x201d; And not me was the unspoken thought. He chuckled to himself. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve no doubt that your services are more valuable,&#x201d; he muttered. He put the bowl aside and squared with Jacob. &#x201c;Then tell me. What would you hire me to do?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your fee is sixpence a day?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Plus expenses, if I must travel.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course, of course.&#x201d; Jacob stroked his beard and stared into Crispin&#x2019;s wine bowl. The light flickered on its ruby surface. &#x201c;Your discretion&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Have done with this,&#x201d; Crispin growled. &#x201c;You say you know me and my reputation. Then get on with it.&#x201d;<br>The man nodded deferentially, a skill learned, no doubt, from the lessons of subservience. &#x201c;Very well. Valuable parchments have been stolen from my apartments. They must be returned.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Valuable in what way? Deeds?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If only they were so mundane. But they are important, nonetheless. Can you help me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Recover lost parchments? For sixpence a day, I will see what I can do. But it might help to know what they are.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh . . .&#x201d; He waved his hand and quickly hid it again under the table. &#x201c;Texts. In Hebrew. You would not find them significant.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But clearly someone did. And you called it &#x2018;dangerous,&#x2019; if I recall.&#x201d; Jacob said nothing. He merely blinked, his papery lids folding over hazel eyes. &#x201c;Some scholar who wished to examine them?&#x201d; Crispin offered to the silence.<br>&#x201c;Perhaps.&#x201d; Jacob tugged on his beard again before he seemed to realize the habit and lowered his hand to his lap.<br>Crispin sighed. Lost parchments seemed more trouble than they were worth, especially for a Jew. But coin was coin. &#x201c;I shall have to see your apartments. And to do that, well, it will be difficult. I must raise my fee and charge one shilling a day for my trouble.&#x201d;<br>The man seemed startled. &#x201c;Why must you see my apartments?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;To examine the place from which they were stolen. From this I might garner valuable information.&#x201d; He studied the quiet man and his stooped posture. &#x201c;Out of curiosity, why have you not gone to either of the sheriffs with this theft? Or complained to the king, since you have his ear?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. I have come to you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That you have. But it does not explain&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>Jacob rose abruptly. &#x201c;Come to the palace gate, and I will meet you there at nightfall.&#x201d;<br>Crispin rose more slowly. The meeting was apparently over. &#x201c;Very well. There is the warrant of my fee . . .&#x201d;<br>Jacob&#x2019;s eyes widened and he wrestled with his robe for a moment before producing a small leather pouch. He placed it on the table between them. &#x201c;There is four shillings&#x2019; worth of silver there. Till nightfall, Ma�tre Guest.&#x201d;<br>Crispin took up the pouch and clenched it in his fist. &#x201c;Master Jacob,&#x201d; he said with a curt nod of his head.<br>He watched the man hurriedly leave and looked again at the small pouch. He pulled out one coin and left it on the table for Eleanor. At least he had been able to pay his way today.<br>UPON RETURNING TO HIS lodgings, Crispin explained it to Jack, who had been glad to hear that Crispin was hired but was not as pleased to hear that the man was a Jew.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re taking money from a Jew? Ain&#x2019;t they the ones who crucified our Lord?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So says Holy Scriptures.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then they aught not to be in England. The law was made ages ago.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You will find, Jack, that laws and kings are rarely to be met within the same sentence.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Eh?&#x201d;<br>Crispin snorted. &#x201c;Whatever King Richard desir...</p><h2>The Church That Works</h2><p><b><i>The Church That Works: Democracy vs. Theocracy</i></b> is a focus on how giving back His church releases followers of Jesus Christ to serve and unleashes God's power to back them.

They have transformed the way we see ourselves - and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives - and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization, and helped make us who we are.</p><p>"These are the times that try men's souls," begins Thomas Paine's first Crisis paper, the impassioned pamphlet that helped ignite the American Revolution. Published in Philadelphia in January of 1776, <i>Common Sense</i> sold 150,000 copies almost immediately. A powerful piece of propaganda, it attacked the idea of a hereditary monarchy, dismissed the chance for reconciliation with England, and outlined the economic benefits of independence while espousing equality of rights among citizens. Paine fanned a flame that was already burning, but many historians argue that his work unified dissenting voices and persuaded patriots that the American Revolution was not only necessary, but an epochal step in world history.The Library of America is an award-winning, nonprofit program dedicated to publishing America&#39;s best and most significant writing in handsome, enduring volumes, featuring authoritative texts.

Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations �1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

It had taken me nearly two weeks to convince him--you would think I was a child, not a young man of twenty. It seems a small victory, but I've won so few in the past months that it means everything to me--perhaps even the beginning of my recovery. Just before leaving, I bought this book of Japanese parchment paper to record any other prizes I might be lucky enough to capture. It opens before me now, thin sheets of sand-colored paper, empty and quiet as the beach below the village. Since I became ill last spring in Canton, I've had no time to myself. When I was too weak to continue studying, my instructors at Lingnan University ordered me home. My friend King accompanied me on the train, and hovered over me all the way home to Hong Kong. I'll never forget the frightened look in my mother's eyes the day I returned. It was like an animal's fear for her young. I couldn't stop coughing long enough to catch my breath. When King and a manservant carried me up the concrete steps of our house, my mother stood in her green silk <i>cheungsam,</i> lips pressed tightly together in a straight line as if she were holding back a scream. Once home I was constantly under her cautious eyes, and those of our old servant Ching. The two women monitored my every move, as if I might wilt away right before their eyes. That's how they looked at me sometimes, as though I were already a memory. I can understand their concern. My days were still punctuated by fevers in the late afternoon and a persistent dry cough. All through the thick, sticky summer, the heat made things worse. When my illness was diagnosed as tuberculosis by an English doctor, my mother sent a telegram to my father in Kobe. Her concernturned to dread and she forbade my younger sister Penelope, whom I've called Pie ever since she was born, to enter my room. Every morning Pie balanced on the threshold and smiled at me, looking smaller than her twelve years. There are four of us children in all. My older sister Anne and my younger brother Henry are now back at school in Macao. My parents gave us all Christian names at birth, since my father believes it an asset in the business world to be addressed with ease by Westerners. His import-export business thrives on such progressive ideas. It seems the apartment he keeps in Japan is more his home than our family house in Hong Kong. He makes his life in both places and the way he bows low with eyes averted seems at times more Japanese than Chinese to me. By late July, the heat had settled in on Hong Kong, while my fevers advanced and retreated. A heavy stillness had descended on our house, as if everyone was moving in slow motion. My mother was even more nervous than usual. Two days later, the news came over the radio that the Japanese had captured Tientsin and surrounded Peking. Hong Kong was stifling in August. Some afternoons I could barely breathe. My father wrote: "Send Stephen to me in Kobe, I will take him to Tarumi. The climate is drier there, and the air is much fresher than in Hong Kong." My mother ordered Ching to prepare for my journey to Japan, while the Japanese occupied Peking and sent their warships to Shanghai. I hated to leave my family and friends, even though I hadn't been allowed to see them. I felt lonelier than ever. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> In some ways I can't help thinking my time in Tarumi will be a quiet resembling death. At least the sea breezes are much more soothing than the hot, humid heat of Hong Kong. Late in August, the Japanese invaded Shanghai where a bloody standoff continues. Thousands of refugees have fled China and have built their makeshift homes in the crowded streets of Hong Kong. On the way to the harbor, we smelled their greasy street cooking and saw their gaunt, desolate faces begging for money and understanding. Then, at the pier in Kowloon, my mother and Pie looked bereft, too, as they waved good-bye to Ching and me.Only after she thought I had disappeared into the crowds did my mother lift her white lace handkerchief to her eyes. All the way to Japan on board the <i>President Wilson,</i> Ching refused to let me sit on the sun-drenched deck without wearing at least three sweaters. When we finally arrived in Kobe, she clung to me whispering and hissing, "These are the Japanese devils who have driven our Chinese out of their homes." I looked out through the taxi window at the bustling crowds, but except for small groups of soldiers loitering in public places, rifles slung on their shoulders, these Japanese appeared harmless to me. I was relieved when Ching left me with my father and hurried home to Hong Kong. My father had been waiting for us at his apartment. I could tell by the way his body tensed that he was shocked at my appearance, but he tried not to show it. "Stephen," he said, "it's good to see you." His eyes surveyed my feverish face and too-thin body before he hugged me and touched my wavy hair. My hair has always delighted him, because it isn't straight like most Chinese. Then he stepped back and said softly, "We will see that Michiyo makes her <i>sukiyaki</i> tonight." Kobe was only slightly cooler than Hong Kong, and Michiyo watched over me as closely as Ching. My father worked long hours and couldn't get away to take me to Tarumi as he had hoped. Transportation had been interrupted all over China, and his business was hanging in the balance. The more Michiyo fussed at me to rest, to eat, the less I was able to do either. It was then I realized there wasn't any reason why I couldn't find my own way to the village of Tarumi. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> This morning in Kobe, I rose early, dressed, and had finished packing before my father knocked gently on the door to awaken me. I packed lightly, bringing only one suit, comfortable clothes, several books, my oil paints, and two tablets of paper. My father promised to send me some canvases shortly. The drive to the train station was quiet, my father asking only twice if I was feeling well enough to travel. Even my coughing had eased. When we arrived at the station, he suddenly turned around and asked, "Do you have enough money?" "Yes, you've given me more than enough," I answered, my hand instantly feeling for my wallet in my jacket pocket. "You know you can always reach me at the downtown number." "I know, Ba-ba, I know," I said. It was something he had been telling me for the past two weeks. "The most important thing is that you take care of yourself, rest, and don't tire yourself out with your painting." My father looked away as he said this, always awkward when it came to the subject of my painting, which he saw as a time-consuming hobby. "I won't," I answered, knowing that my only solace in being exiled to Tarumi was that I would have more time for my painting. My father excused himself to make sure my luggage was safely aboard the train. He had agreed to let me go alone only after he wired the servant at the beach house to be waiting for me at the station. I saw him slip a Japanese porter extra money to watch me on this short journey. He returned through the crowd, telling me to board and get settled. He grasped my hand tightly. "I'll see you in a week or two," he said. "You don't have to worry about me," I reassured him as I boarded the train. "I'll be fine." I watched my father from the train window, a small man in his dark double-breasted suit and thin, rimless glasses, standing next to a group of Japanese children. My father usually seemed so short, but as the train pulled out and he lifted his arm to wave, I thought he looked tall in the fading light. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> The train was half-filled with elderly Japanese men and women, and mothers with small children who exchanged conversation with one another in hurried whispers. They mostly spoke of their children from what I could understand, and I was relieved when we finally left the outskirts of the city and I could focus my attention on the fleeting landscape outside the window. It was greener than I remembered, with large pine trees waving against a sky so sharp and clear that I felt as if I could almost reach out and grab one of their long, spiny arms. My mother had taken us to Tarumi for two summers of our childhood. I still remember her complaintsabout the heat, and her elaborate silk-painted fan, as she moved the thick air in front of her in quick, short strokes. After a while, I was hypnotized by the passing scene. My eyes felt hot and tired. It was the first time since leaving my family in Hong Kong that I had thought about being completely alone. With my father only a few hours away in Kobe, and my mother planning to visit me in a matter of months, I could only breathe in both the fear and attraction of facing the unknown. A little girl walked down the aisle of the train staring in my direction. When I looked up at her and smiled, she bowed her head shyly, then rushed back to her mother. She reminded me of Pie, though Pie might have stopped and spoken to a stranger to satisfy her curiosity. She has always been my favorite, with her large round eyes and pigtails. Part of the reason I was sent to Tarumi was to avoid infecting Pie. As a small child, she was the one who was always sick. Her frailty was equalled only by her quick, sharp eye and teasing nature. She and Henry were constantly entangled in something, often leading to violent fights. It worried me at first, until I realized Pie was always intelligent enough to know when to stop. After my illness was diagnosed, Ching tried not to let Pie get too near, but Pie refused to listen, poking her head into my room whenever she could. When Pie found out I was leaving for Japan, she slyly slipped into my room after everyone had gone to sleep. Ching always left a small light in the entryway for anyone who had to make a trip to the water closet during the night. In the stillness, Pie entered and whispered my name until I awakened. I knew immediately it was she by the smell of mothballs on her sleeveless, yellow silk pajamas with flowers embroidered on the front. "What are you doing here? I asked, rubbing the sleep from my eyes and sitting up. I coughed, and was quick to cover my mouth. "You're leaving with Ching tomorrow to see Ba-ba, so I've come to say good-bye," she answered. "I'll miss your handsome face." "You shouldn't be in here, you might get sick," was all I could say. I could see Pie smile in the muted light from the hall. She threw her thin, pale arms around my neck and kissed me on the cheek. Her lips felt cool against my warmth. "Go now," I said. "I'll see you soon." Pie reluctantly withdrew her arms and ran to the door. "I'll write to you," she said, closing the door and leaving me in darkness. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> When the train blew its whistle and slowed down for the Tarumi station this afternoon, I waited until it came to a complete stop. All around me were the anxious movements of others gathering their belongings. The station itself was just a one-room wooden building set on a wooden platform. I looked about and saw several Japanese women in kimonos, waiting along with a couple of older men. I leaned back uneasily and searched my mind, unable to remember how Matsu, the caretaker of the beach house, looked. Our last visit had been years ago, and I only remembered catching glimpses of him as he went about his duties. I was afraid of him. Matsu had seemed old to me then, so I was surprised when my father said he would be the one waiting for me at the station today. I waited, letting the others disembark first, then followed behind them. Some were greeted at once, while others scrambled off by themselves in different directions. I walked to the middle of the platform, put down my suitcase, and watched for any sign of Matsu, already preparing myself to find the beach house on my own. It was a warm afternoon and my shirt was wet down the length of my back. I tried to remember which direction the house was, but every road appeared vaguely familiar. The crowd was beginning to thin when out of the building came a heavyset man with close-cropped gray hair. Nervously, I watched him approach. "Pao-Lin Chan's grandson?" he asked, stopping a few feet from me. He was dressed in baggy khaki trousers and a gray sweater. I felt skinny and small next to him, though I was a good foot taller. "Yes, and you're Matsu- <i>san?</i>" I asked. He gave me several stiff bows, which I returned. Before I could say anything else, Matsu had taken my suitcase and begun to walk to the station. At the door of the shabby building, he stopped and stared impatiently, waiting for me to pass through first. My father told me Matsu has lived alone and taken care of mygrandfather's beach house for the past thirty years. After his parents died, he was given the choice either to join my grandfather's Hong Kong household, or stay in Japan by himself to care for the beach house. Matsu has worked for our family since he was a boy, and his parents worked for my grandfather before that. He appears about sixty, with weathered, umber colored skin and a remote, impatient manner. He seems the type of man who's more comfortable alone, and it's not hard to figure out that he must be annoyed at my disturbing his tranquil world. The road to the beach house was powdered with white sand and felt stifling in the hazy heat. It was late afternoon and the sun exerted its last burst of energy before disappearing into evening. We walked past a few bamboo-fenced houses, which increased in number as we continued down the road. I was sweating heavily by then. Matsu silently walked in his quick gait a few steps ahead of me, as if he were all by himself. I increased my pace, pushing myself to keep up. The farther we walked, the more fine sand lined the road. The salty sea air filled my head, and from beyond the dune came the steady surge of waves. In between, I felt consumed by the quiet, so different from the summers I had spent here surrounded by my family and the noise of playful children. This early autumn there didn't seem to be anyone else here, just me, Matsu, and a complete, white silence. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> I was exhausted by the time Matsu stopped in front of one of the many bamboo-fenced houses and cleared his throat to get my attention. My lungs were burning and my legs weak. Matsu wasn't about to treat me like an invalid. Never once had he stopped, or even asked to see if I was all right. My mother and Ching would have fussed over me, made me rest every five minutes. "Stephen, you mustn't tire yourself out, rest, rest, go slowly," they would say, as their high-pitched voices pierced the air. I watched Matsu put down the suitcase and proceed to unlock the gate. My grandfather's house stood on the right side of the road on the slight slope of a hill. Across the road was the path down to the beach. I remembered how Henry and I used to race down it during our stay here. Matsu gestured for me to enter first. Stepping through thebamboo gate, I found myself in the garden. The sweet perfumes were immediately intoxicating. A silk tree, still heavy with summer blossoms, and two large black pine trees shaded the house. An oval-shaped pond, with hints of movement that flashed orange and silver beneath its surface, dominated one side of the garden. It was surrounded by pale green moss. A wooden bridge arched across its width, and lin...</p><h2>Inventory: A Memoir</h2><p><p><b>A lyrical memoir and family history told through four generations of fathers and sons in Northern Ireland</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>A smuggler and a deserter, Darran Anderson&#x2019;s grandfather skirted the Second World War on the fringes of legality.

I smiled.<br><br>&#x201c;We brought some bread for you,&#x201d; I said, trying to break his distant trance. &#x201c;I will try to bring some fruit on my next visit, but the city is pretty short on food these days.&#x201d;<br><br>Leinad turned to us and gazed into my eyes. <i>&#x201c;Time </i>is short,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The power of the King is near, and the Dark One is mounted. You must be ready...the people must be ready!&#x201d;<br><br>We were used to Leinad&#x2019;s odd talk, but today he seemed overcome with his delusions.<br><br>&#x201c;My mission is nearly complete,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The Sword of the King sings in anticipation of the One who is worthy!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;your sword has no equal in splendor or beauty, that is certain. You have done well in its keeping.&#x201d; I rested my hand on his shoulder. &#x201c;Leinad, we must leave you now, but I will return in a few days to check on you. We can talk more then.&#x201d;<br><br>Leinad smiled. &#x201c;Very well, Cedric. Thank you for the bread. The King will remember your kindness to me.&#x201d;<br><br>I bowed and smiled as I winked at William. &#x201c;Good day then, Sir Leinad,&#x201d; I said as we turned toward the door.<br><br>Outside William took a deep breath and shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;Someday, William, you and I will be hallucinating fools too,&#x201d; I said as we quickened our pace to make the procession.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you should humor the old man so much,&#x201d; William said.<br><br>&#x201c;What harm can it do? Leinad is old, and if he wants to spend his final years believing in something more than we are living...then why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but I think you crossed the line with that bit about the sword,&#x201d; William said as we entered the city.<br><br>&#x201c;The sword is real,&#x201d; I said. Soon I realized I was walking by myself. I turned around to see William standing still with a perplexed look on his face.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Leinad owns a sword that is more magnificent than any I&#x2019;ve ever seen&#x2013;even more beautiful than any of the swords owned by the Noble Knights.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where did he get such a sword?&#x201d; he asked, still not quite believing me.<br><br>&#x201c;His story is long and bizarre, William. In truth, I do not know how he came to own it. He keeps it wrapped in a cloth in that old wooden chest in the corner. I fear that someone would kill him for it if they knew it was there. That is why I have told no one about it.&#x201d;<br><br>William rejoined me, but his gait was slower now, and his thoughts appeared to be deep.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure about this sword, Cedric?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been years, but I&#x2019;ve seen it myself. It nearly glows in its splendor. Why someone would give a sword like that to Leinad is a mystery indeed.&#x201d;<br><br>At the city&#x2019;s main thoroughfare, we pushed our way to the front of the crowd. Beside us a woman with two small children waited, hoping for a scrap of food the Noble Knights might throw her way. The children&#x2019;s faces were as dirty as their clothes. Poverty overwhelmed the people.<br><br>The sound of hooves on cobblestone announced the knights&#x2019; approach.<br><br>&#x201c;Their horses prance and snort to match the arrogance of their riders,&#x201d; I said in low tones to William.<br><br>&#x201c;Enough, Cedric. After all, these Noble Knights are the chosen, are they not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The King has been gone so long that I wonder if He even remembers this dreadful land.&#x201d;<br><br>A poor old peasant woman was begging from one of the knights as he passed. &#x201c;Please, good sir, a bit o&#x2019; food for a hungry old woman?&#x201d;<br><br>He laughed as he threw a half-eaten apple her way. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t eat it all at once,&#x201d; he sneered.<br><br>The old woman picked up the dirt-covered apple and ate it as though it was her last meal. Maybe it would be.<br><br>The Noble Knights often passed through the streets handing out tidbits of food to show their goodwill toward the people. I believed they did it to inflate their egos; they loved their position over the people. But they had been chosen by the King to defend our land, and from all I had heard of the King, He was just and fair. Somehow, since He&#x2019;d left for another country, the welfare of the kingdom had continually declined.<br><br>&#x201c;Here, old man, have a feast today.&#x201d;<br><br>One of the knights threw a loaf of bread to a bent old man just in front of me. I prepared for my opportunity, fully expecting the feeble old man to miss. I saw his hand reach up for the hurled loaf. The gnarled fingers I expected to see were not gnarled at all. The hand was quick and strong. He snatched the loaf with such ease and purpose that I looked a fool as I grabbed a handful of air.<br><br>The old man wore rags that covered his head and body. He began to turn around. As he did, his back slowly straightened until I faced a man who was a full three inches taller than I. He was not bent or gnarled or old. On the contrary, this man was close to my age and had shoulders as broad as a horse. His arms were defined and powerful. One could even see strength in his jaw as he removed the cloth that covered his head.<br><br><i>A man&#x2019;s eyes give away the story of his character, </i>my father once told me. I forced myself to gaze into the eyes of the stranger. I felt as though he had already questioned my eyes for my character. His eyes burned like fire. They penetrated into the very depths of my soul. They were not eyes of hate or malice&#x2013;far from it. I saw power yet meekness, forcefulness yet gentleness, discipline yet compassion. I had never seen eyes like his!<br><br>He stretched forth his hand with the loaf of bread and offered it to me. I slowly took it from him.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me, Cedric,&#x201d; the stranger said in a rich voice, &#x201c;what do you hope for?&#x201d;<br><br>My mind was fuzzy. I heard the hungry cry of one of the children beside me. How selfish I felt. I was ready to rob an old man of his bread, and instead he gave me the very thing I&#x2019;d hoped to take.<br><br>I knelt down to the child and gave her the loaf of bread. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I haven&#x2019;t more to give you,&#x201d; I told the child&#x2019;s mother.<br><br>I turned to the stranger once more. &#x201c;I am a man of little hope, sir. The kingdom becomes more dreary every day. The people are starving, and the Noble Knights are the only ones who fare well. What is there to hope for? Were I foolish enough to hope, it would be that Arrethtrae was a kingdom free from hunger. A kingdom of truth, justice, and honor. A kingdom where men may serve the King as knights though only common blood flows through their veins, where each man&#x2019;s character, not his family name, determines his worth. No, hopes and dreams you will not find in my heart, for I am too acquainted with disappointment already. If you&#x2019;re looking for dreams, William here is the one to talk to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what are your dreams, William?&#x201d; the stranger asked as he turned toward him.<br><br>William seemed as taken aback by the stranger&#x2019;s gaze as I had been. &#x201c;You are clothed as a peasant, though you hardly look the role. Tell me who you are, sir, and I shall tell you my dreams.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am a man from a distant land,&#x201d; the stranger said. &#x201c;What are your dreams, William?&#x201d;<br><br>William paused. &#x201c;I dream of becoming a knight and serving my King as the Noble Knights do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And would you also pass out scraps of food to the poor as the Noble Knights do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I <i>am </i>the poor, sir. I would never forget these people or their demise. I would defend my King and serve His people.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well spoken, gentlemen. Do not despair. The King knows the plight of His people in Arrethtrae. I bid you farewell, &#x2018;Cedric of Little Hope&#x2019; and &#x2018;William of Dreams.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>With that, the stranger turned and disappeared into the throng of people.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, William,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;it looks as though you are not alone in your dreamworld.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That man is more than a dreamer, and you know it. His peasant clothes don&#x2019;t fool me. There was something about that man!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, yes, I&#x2019;m sure he runs a dreamers guild you could join.&#x201d; I laughed and slapped William on the back.<br><br><i>There </i>was <i>something about that man, </i>I thought.</p><h2>The Supreme Philosophy Of Man: The Laws of Life</h2><p>As you open this book, you will begin an exciting and inspirational adventure into new realms of self-knowledge and self-fulfillment, exploring the basic laws of man&#39;s nature and his world, the 47 LAWS OF LIFE.

Fortunv was born in Granada in 1871 into an illustrious Spanish family remarkable for its numerous artist and architect members. His father was a painter, and both parents were avid collectors of the rare and beautiful in furniture, art objects and textiles; Fortuny&#39;s mother had a magnificent collection of Renaissance brocades and velvets. With such a background, it is not surprising that Fortuny developed a trained eye and a passion for collecting at an early age...

He lives on Cape Cod.LAND OF THE MAYA: PRESENT DAY<br>1<br>From a high escarpment just below the cliff&#x2019;s rim, Cooper Jones studied her team resting on the trail below: Rita &#x201c;Reets&#x201d; Critchlow&#x2014;a fellow archeolinguist&#x2014;flanked by Hargrave and Jamesy. All three wore dusty fatigues, camouflage T-shirts with the sleeves cut off, heavy boots, and sweat-stained dirty-white baseball caps. Reets&#x2019; and Coop&#x2019;s caps bore the Diablos Rojos del M�xico&#x2019;s team logo, while Jamesy&#x2019;s and Hargrave&#x2019;s caps rooted for the Leones de Yucat�n.<br>Mexico City Red Devils and Yucat�n Lions, Coop thought grimly. Right now I feel more like a heat-sick Gila monster.<br>No shade protected them from the blistering sun, and Jamesy was pulling his shirt off. Both men&#x2019;s bodies were graphic studies in macabre violence&#x2014;specifically, knife and gunshot wounds&#x2014;but Jamesy&#x2019;s chest and back scars were an unnervingly turned-out oeuvre. The first time she stumbled on him bathing in a stream with his shirt off&#x2014;and had seen the knife slash diagonally traversing his chest, the barely healed bullet hole entering and exiting his broad right shoulder, and the wide white stripes of some long-forgotten prison hellhole disfiguring his back&#x2014;she&#x2019;d understood the kind of men he and Hargrave were.<br>Not that she&#x2019;d needed scars to garner that insight. Their eyes said everything&#x2014;eyes that neither asked nor gave, and stares hard enough to crack concrete.<br>&#x201c;Eyes that diced at the foot of the cross,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d once told Reets.<br>&#x201c;And slogged the long road back from Stalin grad,&#x201d; Reets had said.<br>&#x201c;Hard enough to crack concrete,&#x201d; Coop had concluded.<br>Then, of course, there were the mirthless grins that never reached those eyes.<br>Men she and Reets now trusted with their lives.<br>... Reets had summed up their situation two nights before:<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re hunted by the most sadistic, pistol-whipping, water-boarding mercenaries north of the Rio; by Mexico&#x2019;s most sadistic, gonad-electrocuting, mordida-stealing, child-pimping federales; by the most sadistic, prodigiously powerful drug cartel in two continents&#x2014;the Apachureros.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You mean we&#x2019;re hunted by... sadists?&#x201d; Hargrave asked.<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Reets said, &#x201c;cloistered nuns.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not in some kind of trouble, are we?&#x201d; Jamesy asked.<br>&#x201c;Not unless you call drawing and quartering, hot coals and knives, followed by death of a thousand cuts ... trouble.&#x201d; Reets replied.<br>&#x201c;They have their side of it,&#x201d; Hargrave countered.<br>Reets nodded her assent. &#x201c;After all, we&#x2019;ve stolen some of their homeland&#x2019;s most historically important, preposterously priceless relics.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The &#x2018;2012 Apocalyptic Codices,&#x2019; as our intrepid president describes them,&#x201d; Hargrave said. &#x201c;You can understand why they want them back and us dead?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I blame the president,&#x201d; Jamesy said. &#x201c;Some hijo de puta on his staff&#x2019;s ratting us out.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Telling the Apachureros, what those codices are worth and where to find us,&#x201d; Hargrave said.<br>&#x201c;Codices we now control,&#x201d; Coop said.<br>&#x201c;And which our bandit buddies want,&#x201d; Jamesy said.<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s also those dozen or so of their bullet-riddled friends we so carelessly left on our back-trail,&#x201d; Hargrave threw in.<br>&#x201c;Someone in Washington put a bounty on us,&#x201d; Jamesy said coldly.<br>&#x201c;Those Pach want us muy malo,&#x201d; Hargrave said.<br>&#x201c;So they can steal the stuff we stole,&#x201d; Reets said....<br>... Well, onward and upward, Cooper Jones thought. At the top of the jungle-shrouded cliff waited a man who she hoped had the last of the Quetzalcoatl codices.<br>The inestimable Jack Phoenix.<br>The bravest, cleverest, most outrageous archeologist the gods ever made&#x2014;his detractors often added psychopathic to those adjectives&#x2014;Jack Phoenix was also one of Coop&#x2019;s and Reets&#x2019; two closest friends.<br>&#x201c;One of our two only friends,&#x201d; Reets once remarked after eight tequila shooters.<br>They&#x2019;d begun pooling resources almost a decade ago and they now trusted him with their most confidential findings. Through a covert communications network of seemingly innocuous weblogs, they passed information critical to their work and careers&#x2014;so much so, they encrypted their e-mails to keep other archeologists from ripping off their findings.<br>Phoenix typically sought her and Reets&#x2019; help in translating indecipherable pre-Columbian glyphs, knowing that Coop, in particular, was preeminently, almost preternaturally gifted in such linguistics. In exchange, he passed data on to them, describing unpublicized digs and sites, which he himself had often uncovered but kept secret.<br>His last posts contained information that had shaken them to their souls.<br>At his Chiapas meeting place&#x2014;an unexplored site deep in Apachurero country&#x2014;he believed they&#x2019;d find their missing codex.<br>Coop allowed herself another quiet sigh. Working her way up to the cliff&#x2019;s rim, she pulled herself up over the boulder-strewn, outwardly jutting cliff top. Crawling over rocks, through brush, over fallen trees toward the ruin, she surveyed the terrain, looking for intruders.<br>Until a blast of harsh laughter stopped her.<br>Hiding behind a log, she spotted the source&#x2014;a group of raucously drunken bandits.<br>She counted at least ten of them.<br>Grizzled inebriated Apachureros in phony federales uniforms, they were armed to the teeth with automatic weapons and pointing at Jack Phoenix&#x2019;s partially excavated temple.<br>Waiting for Jack Phoenix to emerge from the subterranean tunnel entrance he had written them about.<br>Waiting for their friend.<br>Excerpted from The 2012 Codex by Gary Jennings.<br>Copyright � 2010 by Gary Jennings.<br>Published in September 2010 by A Tom Doherty Associates Book.<br>All rights reserved.

A cast of fugitive characters share their desperate lives&#x2015;failed novelists, forgotten literary critics, cruel husbands, puzzled historians, armed robbers, jobless alcoholics, exasperated girlfriends, high school dropouts, drowned children, and defeated boxers. These characters populate love poems ("My love, we know how species run extinct"), satires ("The way of the human variety, / Not even happy just being happy"), elegies ("The cold edge of the world closed on you, kissed / You shut"), and songs of sorrow ("Seasons start slowly. They end that way too"). The original rhyme scheme devised for this sequence--ABCABCDEFDEFGG--allows the author to dust off of the Italian "little song" and Americanize the Elizabethan love poem for the twenty-first century. Speaking at times in propria persona ("We'll head out, you and me, have a pint"), at times in the voice of both male and female characters ("I'm sorry I left you that day at MoMA"), at times across historical gulfs ("Caesar and Charlemagne, Curie, Capone"), <i>Sixty Sonnets</i> marshals both trivia and tragedy to tell stories of modern America, at last achieving a hard-won sense of careful optimism, observing "the last, noble pull of old ways restored, / Valued and unwanted, admired and ignored."</p><p><b>Ernest Hilbert</b> is the editor of the <i>Contemporary Poetry Review</i>.

Currently, he<br>is cohost of KGSRFM&#x2019;s<br>morning drive-time program, Kevin &amp; Kevin.Texas journalist Phinney's first book traces the history of race relations as seen through commingling musical crossovers and a parade of personalities: from Al Jolson to Louis Jordan, Billie Holiday to Bonnie Raitt, Zip Coon to Pat Boone. This comprehensive coverage spans all genres, including blues, country, gospel, jazz, R&amp;B, ragtime, rock and rap. With blackface minstrelsy, "whites opened a portal to their own hidden creative impulses," and Phinney explores this theme as he covers "white men in transparent blackface" (Eminem), "multi-culti chanteuses" (Mariah Carey) and "sepia Sinatras" (Johnny Mathis). Anecdotes abound, and many music history milestones punctuate Phinney's probing critical commentary. Analyzing Nat King Cole's singing style and how it made him "one of the first modern artists to 'cross over' from black to white popularity," Phinney recounts how Cole, only months before the premiere of his 1956&#x2013;1957 NBC television show, was assaulted onstage in Birmingham, Ala., by five white men. Phinney writes with verve and vitality, articulately charting hundreds of black and white intersections in this definitive roadmap to racial rhythms. 45 b&amp;w photos. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As Ronda shares, Southerners don&#39;t just talk about God, they have a &#39;kitchen-table faith,&#39; that feels like a comfortable, trusted neighbor who sits down and stays for a good, long visit. It&#39;s a faith you live and breathe, day-in, day-out, whether it&#39;s praying to the good Lord as you sit on the porch swing or finding joy in a delicious pan of cornbread. As Ronda says, Southern faith &#39;is a faith that is plain, simple, and sturdy, that is utilitarian in practice and that fits as comfortably in the hands of Southern women as a baby, an iron skillet, a hair brush, a telephone, or a broom.&#39; From stories of moonshine and revivals, Sunday dinners and new Easter outfits, prayers answered and griefs shared, you&#39;ll discover a faith that supports you when the trials and heartaches of life cause you to stumble, a faith that grabs you by the elbow and steadies you on the path.</p><p>Ronda Rich, an eleventh-generation Southerner, is the bestselling author of What Southern Women Know (That Every Woman Should) and a popular national columnist. She speaks with Southern charm and humor at over a hundred events each year. She has appeared on dozens of television and radio shows. Ronda and her dachshund, Dixie Dew, make their home among the red clay hills of her native homeland. For more on Ronda, visit www.RondaRich.comFormer journalist and NASCAR publicist Rich, a spirited speaker on the evangelical Christian circuit, has much to say on this subject. With stylish sass, Rich wants to convince her readers that Southern women of faith have a distinct edge over females living anywhere but those warmer climes. Rich shares comical asides to all of life's experiences as she declares that Southern women would never be caught dead wearing the same dress two days in a row&#x2014;even at their own funeral. The author also praises her peers' ability to comfort, cajole, and even curse, using that timeless multipurpose expression, Bless her heart. Jesting aside, Rich laces every amusing chapter with the grittiness of genuine, rock-solid faith in God. Tackling such topics as praying and receiving, speaking favor into existence, binding the enemy and doing good to others, Rich's treatise on faith will afford her readers a helping, heaping dose of good old Southern hospitality.

He was born in Rajasthan, India, and for thirty years made countless personal journeys across the vast subcontinent. He travelled along the Ganges, toured the ghats and alleys of Benares and explored the cosmpolitan cities of Calcutta and Mumbai. The result was a series of vibrant photographs that capture the exuberant spirit and restless activity of his native India. Like his hero, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Singh always succeeded in getting into the heart of the scene and intuitively portraying it from the insider's point of view.<br>In his introduction to River of Colour, the first ever retrospective of his work, Raghubir Singh explains what India means to him, focusing in particular on the importance of colour in India. Singh's instinctual affinity with colour is seen again and again in his pictures that follow. Arranged in eleven sections that depict aspects integral to Indian life, including the street, monuments, icons, water and pilgrimages, Singh's photographs reveal everything from the magical to the mundane, providing a comprehensive picture of the country that remains imprinted in the mind.</p><p>Raghubir Singh (1942-1999) is considered by many to have been one of the finest of contemporary photographers. Born in Rajasthan, India, his work is in the permanent collections of a number of major museums, including The Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography. His many publications include books on Kerala, Rasjasthan, Bombay and the Ganges. River of Colour is the first ever retrospective of his work. David Travis is Curator of Photography at the Art Institute of Chicago. His books include Taken by Design: Photographs from the Institute of Design, 1937-1971 and Edward Weston: The Last Years in Carmel.This is the first retrospective collection of the work of Indian photographer Singh (The Grand Trunk Road: A Passage Through India, Aperture, 1995), whose work is in the permanent collections of several major U.S. museums. Singh has been compared to Henri Cartier-Bresson in his ability to capture the day-to-day life of ordinary people. In the book's preface, David Travis, curator of photography at the Art Institute of Chicago, remarks that in Singh's photographs, "the wise and mad cultural heritage of India is out in the streets for everyone to see." Unlike Cartier-Bresson, however, Singh uses color with aplomb. In his introductory essay, "River of Color: An Indian View," Singh voices his theories about color, photography, and art in general. This large-format volume features 128 full-page and two-page color photographs, divided by theme. They are followed by four pages of notes.

To his son, waiting patiently in the car while he peddles beauty wares and quickies to lonely housewives in the south of England, Bunny is a hero, larger than life. But Bunny himself seems only to have a dim awareness of his son&#x2019;s existence, viewing his needs as a distraction from his own relentless pursuit of sex, alcohol and drugs.</p><p>When his bizarre road trip shades into a final reckoning, and when England&#x2019;s small towns seem to become stopping points in a strange, mythical landscape, Bunny realizes that the remnants of his world -- decrepit fathers, vengeful ghosts, jealous husbands and horned psycho-killers -- lurk in the shadows, waiting to exact their toll.</p><p>At turns dark and humane -- and with all the mystery and enigma fans will recognize as Cave&#x2019;s singular vision -- <em>The Death of Bunny Munro</em> questions the nature of sin and redemption, and lays bare the imprints that fathers leave on their sons.</p><p>Check out the website: www.thedeathofbunnymunro.com/</p></p><p><p>Nick Cave, the Australian-born lead singer of The Birthday Party, The Bad Seeds and Grinderman, has been performing music for more than 30 years and is recognized as one of the most gifted songwriters and performers of our time.

He lives in Brighton, England.</p>The Death of Bunny Munro &nbsp;1 <p>I am damned, thinks Bunny Munro in a sudden moment of self-awareness reserved for those who are soon to die. He feels that somewhere down the line he has made a grave mistake, but this realisation passes in a dreadful heartbeat, and is gone &#x2013; leaving him in a room at the Grenville Hotel, in his underwear, with nothing but himself and his appetites. He closes his eyes and pictures a random vagina, then sits on the edge of the hotel bed and, in slow motion, leans back against the quilted headboard. He clamps the mobile phone under his chin and with his teeth breaks the seal on a miniature bottle of brandy. He empties the bottle down his throat, lobs it across the room, then shudders and gags and says into the phone, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t worry, love, everything&#x2019;s going to be all right.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m scared, Bunny,&#x2019; says his wife, Libby.</p><p>&#x2018;What are you scared of? You got nothing to be scared of.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Everything, I&#x2019;m scared of everything,&#x2019; she says.</p><p>But Bunny realises that something has changed in his wife&#x2019;s voice, the soft cellos have gone and a high, rasping violin has been added, played by an escaped ape or something. He registers it but has yet to understand exactly what this means.</p><p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t talk like that. You know that gets you nowhere,&#x2019; says Bunny, and like an act of love he sucks deep on a Lambert &amp; Butler. It is in that instant that it hits him &#x2013; the baboon on the violin, the inconsolable downward spiral of her drift &#x2013; and he says, &#x2018;Fuck!&#x2019; and blows two furious tusks of smoke from his nostrils.</p><p>&#x2018;Are you off your Tegretol? Libby, tell me you&#x2019;ve been taking your Tegretol!&#x2019;</p><p>There is silence on the other end of the line, then a broken, faraway sob.</p><p>&#x2018;Your father called again. I don&#x2019;t know what to say to him. I don&#x2019;t know what he wants. He shouts at me. He raves,&#x2019; she says.</p><p>&#x2018;For Christ&#x2019;s sake, Libby, you know what the doctor said. If you don&#x2019;t take your Tegretol, you get depressed. As you well know, it&#x2019;s dangerous for you to get depressed. How many fucking times do we have to go through this?&#x2019;</p><p>The sob doubles on itself, then doubles again, till it becomes gentle, wretched crying and it reminds Bunny of their first night together &#x2013; Libby lying in his arms, in the throes of some inexplicable crying jag, in a down-at-heel hotel room in Eastbourne. He remembers her looking up at him and saying, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry, I get a little emotional sometimes,&#x2019; or something like that, and Bunny pushes the heel of his hand into his crotch and squeezes, releasing a pulse of pleasure into his lower spine.</p><p>&#x2018;Just take the fucking Tegretol,&#x2019; he says, softening.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m scared, Bun. There&#x2019;s this guy running around attacking women.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What guy?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He paints his face red and wears plastic devil&#x2019;s horns.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Up north. It&#x2019;s on the telly.&#x2019;</p><p>Bunny picks up the remote off the bedside table and with a series of parries and ripostes turns on the television set that sits on top of the mini-bar. With the mute button on, he moves through the channels till he finds some black-and-white CCTV footage taken at a shopping mall in Newcastle. A man, bare-chested and wearing tracksuit bottoms, weaves through a crowd of terrified shoppers. His mouth is open in a soundless scream. He appears to be wearing devil&#x2019;s horns and waves what looks like a big black stick.</p><p>Bunny curses under his breath and in that moment all energy, sexual or otherwise, deserts him. He thrusts the remote at the TV and in a fizz of static it goes out and Bunny lets his head loll back. He focuses on a water stain on the ceiling shaped like a small bell or a woman&#x2019;s breast.</p><p>Somewhere in the outer reaches of his consciousness he becomes aware of a manic twittering sound, a tinnitus of enraged protest, electronic sounding and horrible, but Bunny does not recognise this, rather he hears his wife say, &#x2018;Bunny? Are you there?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Libby. Where are you?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;In bed.&#x2019;</p><p>Bunny looks at his watch, trombones his hand, but cannot focus.</p><p>&#x2018;For Christ&#x2019;s sake. Where is Bunny Junior?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;In his room, I guess.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Look, Libby, if my dad calls again .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He carries a trident,&#x2019; says his wife.</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;A garden fork.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What? Who?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The guy, up north.&#x2019;</p><p>Bunny realises then that the screaming, cheeping sound is coming from outside. He hears it now above the bombination of the air conditioner and it is sufficiently apocalyptic to almost arouse his curiosity. But not quite.</p><p>The watermark on the ceiling is growing, changing shape &#x2013; a bigger breast, a buttock, a sexy female knee &#x2013; and a droplet forms, elongates and trembles, detaches itself from the ceiling, freefalls and explodes on Bunny&#x2019;s chest. Bunny pats at it as if he were in a dream and says, &#x2018;Libby, baby, where do we live?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Brighton.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And where is Brighton?&#x2019; he says, running a finger along the row of miniature bottles of liquor arranged on the bedside table and choosing a Smirnoff.</p><p>&#x2018;Down south.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Which is about as far away from &#x201c;up north&#x201d; as you can get without falling into the bloody sea. Now, sweetie, turn off the TV, take your Tegretol, take a sleeping tablet &#x2013; shit, take two sleeping tablets &#x2013; and I&#x2019;ll be back tomorrow. Early.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The pier is burning down,&#x2019; says Libby.</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The West Pier, it&#x2019;s burning down. I can smell the smoke from here.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The West Pier?&#x2019;</p><p>Bunny empties the tiny bottle of vodka down his throat, lights another cigarette and rises from the bed. The room heaves as Bunny is hit by the realisation that he is very drunk. With arms held out to the side and on tiptoe, Bunny moonwalks across the room to the window. He lurches, stumbles and Tarzans the faded chintz curtains until he finds his balance and steadies himself. He draws them open extravagantly and vulcanised daylight and the screaming of birds deranges the room. Bunny&#x2019;s pupils contract painfully as he grimaces through the window, into the light. He sees a dark cloud of starlings, twittering madly over the flaming, smoking hulk of the West Pier which stands, helpless, in the sea across from the hotel. He wonders why he hadn&#x2019;t seen this before and then wonders how long he has been in this room, then remembers his wife and hears her say, &#x2018;Bunny, are you there?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah,&#x2019; says Bunny, transfixed by the sight of the burning pier and the thousand screaming birds.</p><p>&#x2018;The starlings have gone mad. It&#x2019;s such a horrible thing. Their little babies burning in their nests. I can&#x2019;t bear it, Bun,&#x2019; says Libby, the high violin rising.</p><p>Bunny moves back to the bed and can hear his wife crying on the end of the phone. Ten years, he thinks, ten years and those tears still get him &#x2013; those turquoise eyes, that joyful pussy, ah man, and that unfathomable sob stuff &#x2013; and he lies back against the headboard and bats, ape-like, at his genitals and says, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll be back tomorrow, babe, early.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Do you love me, Bun?&#x2019; says Libby.</p><p>&#x2018;You know I do.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Do you swear on your life?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Upon Christ and all his saints. Right down to your little shoes, baby.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Can&#x2019;t you get home tonight?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I would if I could,&#x2019; says Bunny, groping around on the bed for his cigarettes, &#x2018;but I&#x2019;m miles away.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, Bunny .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you fucking liar .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x2019;</p><p>The line goes dead and Bunny says, &#x2018;Libby? Lib?&#x2019;</p><p>He looks inexplicably at the phone as if he has just discovered he is holding it, then clamshells it shut as another droplet of water explodes on his chest. Bunny forms a little &#x2018;O&#x2019; with his mouth and he shoves a cigarette in it. He torches it with his Zippo and pulls deeply, then emits a considered stream of grey smoke.</p><p>&#x2018;You got your hands full there, darling.&#x2019;</p><p>With great effort Bunny turns his head and looks at the prostitute standing in the bathroom doorway. Her fluorescent pink knickers pulse against her chocolate-coloured skin. She scratches at her cornrows and a slice of orange flesh peeps behind her drug-slack lower lip. Bunny thinks that her nipples look like the triggers on those mines they floated in the sea to blow up ships in the war or something, and almost tells her this, but forgets and draws on his cigarette again and says, &#x2018;That was my wife. She suffers from depression.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s not alone there, sweetheart,&#x2019; she says as she jitters across the faded Axminster carpet, the shocking tip of her tongue protruding pinkly from between her lips. She drops to her knees and takes Bunny&#x2019;s cock in her mouth.</p><p>&#x2018;No, it&#x2019;s a medical condition. She&#x2019;s on medication.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Her and me both, darling,&#x2019; says the girl, across Bunny&#x2019;s stomach.</p><p>Bunny seems to give this reply due consideration as he manoeuvres his hips. A limp black hand rests on his belly, and looking down Bunny sees that each fingernail has the detailed representation of a tropical sunset painted on it.</p><p>&#x2018;Sometimes it gets really bad,&#x2019; he says.</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s why they call it the blues, baby,&#x2019; she says, but Bunny barely hears this as her voice comes out in a low, incomprehensible croak. The hand twitches and then jumps on his stomach.</p><p>&#x2018;Hey? What?&#x2019; he says, sucking air through his teeth, and he gasps suddenly and there it was, blowing up from his heart, that end-of-things thought again &#x2013; &#x2018;I am damned&#x2019; &#x2013; and he folds an arm across his eyes and arches slightly.</p><p>&#x2018;Are you OK, darling?&#x2019; says the prostitute.</p><p>&#x2018;I think a bath is overflowing upstairs,&#x2019; says Bunny.</p><p>&#x2018;Hush now, baby.&#x2019;</p><p>The girl lifts her head and looks fleetingly at Bunny, and he tries to find the centre of her black eyes, the tell-tale pinprick of her pupils, but his gaze loses its intent and blurs. He places a hand on her head, feels the damp sheen on the back of her neck.</p><p>&#x2018;Hush now, baby,&#x2019; she says again.</p><p>&#x2018;Call me Bunny,&#x2019; he says and sees another droplet of water tremble on the ceiling.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll call you any damn thing you want, sweetie.&#x2019;</p><p>Bunny closes his eyes and presses on the coarse ropes of her hair. He feels the soft explosion of water on his chest, like a sob.</p><p>&#x2018;No, call me Bunny,&#x2019; he whispers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Copyright � 2009 by Nick Cave</p><p>All rights reserved</p><p>Originally published in 2009 by the Text Publishing Company, Australia</p><p>Published in the United States by Faber and Faber, Inc.</p><p>First American edition, 2009</p></p><h2>Words from the White House: Words and Phrases Coined or Popularized by America&#39;s Presidents</h2><p><p>The founding fathers (a term created by Warren G. Harding for his "front porch campaign" of 1920) felt that coining words and creating new uses for old ones was part of their role in creating a new American culture and language, distinct from the proscriptive King's English. Noah Webster called the creation of such Americanisms "acts of defiance," along with such radical ideas as universal literacy and public libraries. Ever since, American presidents have enriched our vocabulary with words, phrases, and concepts that weve put to general use. </p><p>Acclaimed lexicographer Paul Dickson has compiled the first collection of new words and lexical curiosities originating on Pennsylvania Avenue. Organized chronologically, each entry contains the definition, etymology, and a brief essay placing the word or phrase in its cultural context. From Washington (<i>tin can</i>) and Jefferson (who alone gets credit for some one hundred coinages, including <i>belittle </i>and the expression<i> holding the bag</i>), to Lincoln (<i>relocate</i>) and Teddy Roosevelt (<i>bully pulpit</i>), to Ike (<i>mulligan</i>) and Obama (<i>Snowmageddon</i>), they collectively provide an illuminating tour of more than two centuries of our history. </p><p>Bloviate ... lunatic fringe ... iffy ... military industrial complex ... Anglophobia ... kitchen cabinet ... public relations ... ottoman ... pedicure ... point well taken ... personal shopper ... normalcy</p></p><p><b>Paul Dickson</b> has written some dozen word books and dictionaries, including <i>The Dickson Baseball Dictionary, A Dictionary of the Space Age</i>, and <i>Slang</i>. An occasional contributor to the late William Safire's "On Language" column in the <i>New York Times</i>, Dickson has coined two words of his own: "word word" (as in the question "Are we talking about an e-book or a book book?") and "demonym" (the name for a person from a specific locality, e.g., New Yorker). He lives in Garrett Park, Maryland.<p>&#x201c;Paul Dickson is the most prolific writer I know. While I have met authors who seem to publish a new book every other week (James Patterson and Nora Roberts come to mind), Dickson's books cover such a wide range of subjects and topics that I consider him to be that one true Vesuvius of books. He never stops writing. Dickson has written his share of dictionaries and word books. The latest, "Words From the White House," examines a plethora of words, terms and expressions that have emanated from the most exalted office in the land, the presidency of the United States. Some of these expressions are now in common usage. Others have languished and faded into obscurity. The book is written in dictionary form, in alphabetical order. Each entry has an explanation of how a word or term was used during a particular presidency. Dickson writes that "using the Oxford English Dictionary and its &#x2018;first evidence for word' credits Thomas Jefferson with 110 new words and 382 new senses for older words." Jefferson was adept at creating new ones. It was Jefferson who concocted the impressive word "neologize." It means: "to coin or use new words or phrases." Here are some "words from the White House" and the presidents who popularized them: George Washington gave us "administration," "average" and "hatchet man." Warren Harding came up with the term "founding fathers." Theodore Roosevelt coined many classics including "loose cannon," "frazzle," "pack rat," "lunatic fringe," "pussyfooter" and "muckraker." Presidents love a catchy phrase. When William Henry Harrison won the presidency in 1840 he employed the slogan "as Maine goes ... so goes the nation." Back then the voters of Maine cast ballots in September, six weeks ahead of time, to get their votes counted before winter came. That same 1840 Harrison campaign engendered the expression "keep the ball rolling." Dickson explains that "an immense steel-ribbed ball covered in canvas and plastered with this and other slogans was pushed from town to town ... ." George W. Bush was often ridiculed for his word inventions. He was mocked for using the word "analyzation" in a speech. Dickson notes that "this is a respectable word dating to 1698." In another speech he declared "this issue doesn't resignate with the people." His use of "resignate" was derided, too. Dickson shows this obscure usage actually dated from the 16th century. Some expressions were quickly forgotten. Here are some examples: "Angloman. Bomfog. Floogie bird. Innocuous desuetude." Dickson explains them all. He closes his entertaining and informative book with a list of "the top ten words invented or promoted by presidents." George W. Bush made the list with this memorable word invention: "misunderestimate.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Vick Mickunas, Dayton Daily News</i></p><p>&#x201c;A compendious, entertaining look at our nation's leaders through words and turns of phrase.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;....thoroughly enjoyable.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Steven Levingston, The Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;The author is an essayist and lexicographer who presents this entertaining look at how presidents have used and shaped our language.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Dispatch (Columbus)</i></p></p><h2>Quacks and Crusaders: The Fabulous Careers of John Brinkley, Norman Baker, and Harry Hoxsey</h2><p>One promoted goat gland transplants as a remedy for lost virility or infertility. Another blamed aluminum cooking utensils for causing cancer. The third was targeted by the Food and Drug Administration as "public enemy number one" for his worthless cures.<br><br>John Brinkley, Norman Baker, and Harry Hoxsey were the ultimate snake oil salesmen of the twentieth century. With backgrounds in lowbrow performance&#x2014;carnivals, vaudeville, night clubs&#x2014;each of these charismatic con men used the emerging power of radio to hawk alternative cures in the Midwest beginning in the roaring twenties, through the Depression era, and into the 1950s. All scorned the medical establishment for avarice while amassing considerable fortunes of their own; and although the American Medical Association castigated them for preying on the ignorant, this book shows that the case against them wasn't all that simple.<br><br><i>Quacks and Crusaders</i> is an entertaining and revealing look at the connections between fraudulent medicine and populist rhetoric in middle America. Eric Juhnke examines the careers of these three personalities to paint a vision of medicine that championed average Americans, denounced elitism, and affirmed rustic values. All appealed to the common man, winning audiences and patrons in rural America by casting their pitches in everyday language, and their messages proved more potent than their medicines in treating the fears, insecurities, and failing health of their numerous supporters.<br><br>Juhnke first examines the career of each man, revealing their geniuses as businessmen and propagandists-with such success that Brinkley and Baker ran for governor of their states and Hoxsey had thousands of supporters protest his "persecution" by the FDA. Juhnke then investigates the identity, motives, and willingness to believe of their many patients and followers. He shows how all three men used populist rhetoric&#x2014;evangelical, anti-Communist, anti-intellectual&#x2014;to attract their clients, and then how their particular brand of populism sometimes mutated to anti-Semitism and other sentiments of the radical right.<br><br>By treating the incurable, Brinkley, Baker, and Hoxsey took on the mantles of common folk crusaders. Brinkley was idolized for his goat gland cures until his death, and Hoxsey's former head nurse continued his work from Tijuana until her death in 1999. In considering who visits quacks and why, Juhnke has shed new light not only on the ongoing battle between alternative and organized medicine, but also on the persistence of quackery&#x2014;and gullibility&#x2014;in American culture.</p><p>"Based on prodigious research, Juhnke&#x2019;s book makes a major contribution to the study of health quackery in America. . . .

And they're unlikely to be disappointed in this city that positively feeds off imperial nostalgia &#x2013; High Baroque churches and aristocratic piles pepper the old town or Innere Stadt, monumental projects from the late nineteenth century line the Ringstrasse, and postcards of the Emperor Franz-Josef and his beautiful wife Elisabeth still sell by the sackful. Just as compelling as the old Habsburg stand-bys are the wonderful Jugendstil and early modernist buildings, products of fin-de-si�cle Vienna, when the city emerged as one of Europe's great cultural centres. This was the era of Freud, Klimt, Schiele, Mahler and Sch�nberg, when the city's famous coffeehouses were filled with intellectuals from every corner of the empire. In a sense, this was Vienna's golden age, after which all has been in decline: with the end of the empire in 1918, the city was reduced from a metropolis of over two million, capital of a vast empire of fifty million, to one of barely more than one-and-a-half million, federal capital of a small country of just eight million souls. </p><p>Given the city's twentieth-century history, it's hardly surprising that the Viennese are as keen as anyone to continue plugging the good old days. This is a place, not unlike Berlin, which has had the misfortune of serving as a weather vane of European history. Modern anti-Semitism as a politically viable force was invented here, in front of Hitler's very eyes, in the first decade of the century. It was the assassination of an arrogant Austrian archduke that started World War I, while the battles between Left and Right fought out in the streets of Vienna mirrored those in Berlin in the 1930s. The weekend Hitler enjoyed his greatest electoral victory in the Reichstag was the day the Austrians themselves invented Austro-fascism. In 1938, the country became the first victim of Nazi expansion, greeting the F�hrer with delirious enthusiasm. And after the war, for a decade, Vienna was divided, like Berlin, into French, American, British and Soviet sectors. </p><p>The visual scars from this turbulent history are few and far between &#x2013; even Hitler's sinister Flackt�rme are confined to the suburbs &#x2013; but the destruction of the city's once enormous Jewish community is a wound that has proved harder to heal. Vienna's Jewish intellectuals and capitalists were the driving force behind much of the city's fin-de-si�cle culture. Little surprise then, that the city has since struggled to live up to its glorious past achievements. After the war Vienna lost its cosmopolitan character and found itself stuck in a monocultural straightjacket. Since the end of the Cold War, however, this has begun to change, with a second wave of immigrants from the former provinces of the old empire. Whether Vienna will learn to accept its new, multicultural identity remains to be seen. </p><p>For all its problems, Vienna is still an inspiring city to visit, with one of the world's greatest art collections in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, world-class orchestras, and a superb architectural heritage. It's also an eminently civilized place, clean, safe (for the most part) and peopled by a courteous population who do their best to live up to their reputation for Gem�tlichkeit or cosiness. And despite its ageing population, it's also a city with a lively nightlife, of late opening Musikcaf�s and drinking holes. Even Vienna's traditional restaurants, long famous for quantity over quality, have discovered innovative methods of cooking and presentation, and are now supplemented by a wide range of ethnic restaurants. </p><p>When to go </p><p>Lying at the centre of Europe, Vienna experiences the extremes of temperature typical of a continental climate with hot summers and correspondingly cold winters. In terms of weather, therefore, late spring and early autumn are by far the best times to visit. There are other reasons, too, for avoiding July and August in particular, as this is when many of the city's theatres and concert halls close down. Sure, there's enough cultural activity to keep the tourists amused, but the Viennese tend to get the hell out. In contrast, Christmas and New Year are peak season in Vienna. Not only does the city look great in the snow &#x2013; and you can be sure that the Viennese are very efficient about keeping the paths clear &#x2013; but also the ball season, known as Fasching, gets underway, along with the glittering Christmas markets, and, of course, the world-famous New Year's Day concert.</p></p><h2>Brown&#39;s Requiem</h2><p>Fritz Brown&#39;s L.A.--and his life--are masses of contradictions, like stirring chorales sung for the dead. A less-than-spotless former cop with a drinking problem--a private eye-cum-repo man with a taste for great music--he has been known to wallow in the grime beneath the Hollywood glitter. But Fritz Brown&#39;s life is about to change, thanks to the appearance of a racist psycho who flashes too much cash for a golf caddie and who walked away clean from a multiple murder rap. Reopening this cas could be Fritz&#39;s redemption; his welcome back to a moral world and his path to a pure and perfect love. But to get there, he must make it through a grim, lightless place where evil has no national borders; where lies beget lies and death begets death; where there&#39;s little tolerance for Bach or Beethoven and deadly arson is a lesser mortal sin; and where a p.i.&#39;s unhealthy interest in the past can turn beautiful music into funeral dirge.</p><p>Before he began to remap the geography of the crime novel and venture out into the darkest <i>noir</i> night of them all with <i>L.A. Confidential</i>, <i>The Black Dahlia</i>, <i>White Jazz</i>, and <i>American Tabloid</i>, James Ellroy started his career with this powerful but basically straightforward book about Los Angeles private eye Fritz Brown. At first glance, the story of an investigation into a crooked golf tournament that opens up to include arson and murder could be just another work by any one of the dozens of good writers who have used Southern California as a metaphor for the decline and fall of civilization. But behind the terse prose, astute readers will soon begin to hear something else--the increasingly loud clamor of a cry of pain that will eventually become the barely manageable madness of Ellroy's later books. <i>--Dick Adler</i><p>James Ellroy was born in Los Angeles in 1948. His L.A. quartet -- <strong>The Black Dahlia</strong>, <strong>The Big Nowhere</strong>, <strong>L.A. Confidential</strong> and <strong>White Jazz</strong> -- were international bestsellers. <strong>American Tabloid</strong> was <em>Time</em>'s Novel of the Year in 1995; his memoir <strong>My Dark Places</strong> was <em>Time</em>'s Best Book and a <em>New York Times</em> Notable book for 1996. His novel <strong>The Cold Six Thousand</strong> was a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book and <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Best Book for 2001. He lives on the coast of California.</p></p><h2>The Town of N (European Classics)</h2><p>Leonid Dobychin's <i>The Town of N,</i> an unrecognized masterpiece of the Soviet 1930s, virtually vanished, together with its author, following its publication in 1935 and the subsequent vilification of Dobychin by Leningrad's cultural authorities. It portrays a fallen provincial world reminiscent of the town of N found in Gogol's <i>Dead Souls,</i> a place populated with characters who are petty, grasping, perfidious, and cruel, quite unlike the positive heroes of socialist realist novels.<br></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: RussianIn his enthusiastic introduction to this lost work, translator Borden calls the rediscovery of Dobychin (who died in 1936, probably by his own hand, after being scorned by the Soviet literary establishment) "the single most significant revelation in Russian letters during glasnost." Dobychin left only a brief body of work, principally this tightly composed, satirical novel published in 1935 and promptly forgotten. It follows the naively credulous stream-of-consciousness of a boy from age seven in 1901 until he is 15, and it skewers, in the manner of Gogol's Dead Souls, the pretensions and oppressions of the provincial society in which he lives, including religious orthodoxy, pompous schoolmasters, rampant sexism and hypocrisy. Indeed, the title is the fictional setting of Gogol's masterpiece, and many of the nicknames that the boy narrator gives to characters derive from that book. Without apparent reflection, in a series of choppy perceptions and associations, the boy relates events of his school years, father's death, readings, mild crushes and the eruption of the Russo-Japanese War, while Dobychin provides the irony. Lovers of Russian literature owe a debt of gratitude to Borden for bringing this important work to the attention of English readers. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Very Best of the Best: 35 Years of The Year&#39;s Best Science Fiction</h2><p><p><b>For the first time in a decade, a compilation of the very best in science fiction, from a world authority on the genre.</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>For decades, <i>the Year's Best Science Fiction</i> has been the most widely read short science fiction anthology of its kind.

If Gardner Dozois says these are the best of the best, you can bet the farm on it.

However, nothing is as it seems.<br><br>Kyle Rankin is a lie. His real name is Eli Brody, and he fled his home world of Caledonia years ago.

In two long fictional poems, a rich narrative momentum engages readers in the mysterious places&#x2014;including Victorian novels&#x2014;where characters, sexualities, and fates are unmade and made.
